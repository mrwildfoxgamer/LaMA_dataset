Objective:
To gain knowledge of the major sea ports located in different states of India.
Sea ports of India:
With a long coastline of 7,516.6 km, India is dotted with 12 major and 200 notified non-majors (minor/intermediate) ports.
These major ports handle 95 percent of India’s foreign trade.
Kandla Port in Kuchchh, also known as Deendayal Port, was the first port to be developed soon after the Independence to ease the volume of trade on the Mumbai port.
Marmagao port is the premier iron ore exporting port and accounts for about fifty percent of India’s iron ore export.
Kandla Port and Kolkata Port are the tidal ports of India.
Mumbai Port is the biggest port with a spacious natural and well-sheltered harbour.
Both Kochchi in south-west and Tuticorin in south-east have natural harbours, Tuticorin Port in addition has  a rich hinterland.
Vishakhapatnam Port which was originally conceived as an outlet for iron ore exports is the deepest landlocked and well-protected port.

Objective
To know about major dams of India.
Dam
A dam is a barrier across flowing water that obstructs, directs or retards the flow, often creating a reservoir, lake or impoundment.“Dam” refers to the reservoir rather than the structure. Most dams have a section called a spillway or weir over which or through which it is intended that water will flow either intermittently or continuously.
How do they help in conserving and managing water?
Dams were traditionally built to impound rivers and rainwater that could be used later to irrigate agricultural fields. Today, dams are built not just for irrigation but for electricity generation, water supply for domestic and industrial uses, flood control, recreation, inland navigation and fish breeding. Hence, dams are now referred to as multi-purpose projects where the many uses of the impounded water are integrated with one another.
Major Dams of India
Major dams in India are Salal, Bhakra Nangal, Hirakud, Tehri, Rana Pratap Sagar, Rihand, Sardar Sarovar, Nagarjuna Sagar, Tungabhadra and Periyar.
1. Salal
The Salal Dam is a run-of-the-river hydropower project on the Chenab River in the Reasi district of Jammu and Kashmir, also known as the Salal Hydroelectric Power Station. It was the first hydropower project established under the Indus Water Treaty regime by India in Jammu and Kashmir. [Refer Fig. 1]
                                                              
                                                                                    Fig. 1: Salal Dam
2. Bhakra Nangal
Bhakra Nangal Dam is a concrete gravity dam on the Satluj River in Bhakra Village near Bilaspur in Bilaspur district, Himachal Pradesh in northern India. It is intended for irrigation as well as hydro-electric purposes. Bhakra dam is straight gravity cum concrete dam having four spillway radial gates with designed spillway capacity of 8212 cumec.
3. Hirakud
India's longest dam is Hirakud Dam. It is built across the Mahanadi River, about 15 kilometres from Sambalpur in the state of Odisha in India. This is one of the oldest hydel projects of India, being the first post-independence major multi purpose river valley project in the country. [Refer Fig. 2]
                                                               
                                                                                Fig. 2: Hirakud Dam
4. Tehri
Tehri Dam Reservoir is the tallest dam in India and also one of the tallest in the world. The dam is constructed on the Bhagirathi river. It taps its potential for irrigation and hydroelectric purposes. The dam can stand flood as well. It is designed for the Probable Maximum Flood of 15540 cumec and a drop of 220m. [Refer Fig. 3]
                                                               
                                                                                   Fig. 3: Tehri Dam
5. Rana Pratap Sagar
The Rana Pratap Sagar Dam is a gravity masonry dam of 53.8 meters (177 ft) height built on the Chambal River at Rawatbhata in Rajasthan in India. It is part of integrated scheme of a cascade development of the river involving four projects starting with the Gandhi Sagar Dam in the upstream reach (48 kilometres upstream) in Madhya Pradesh and the Jawahar Sagar Dam on the downstream (28 kilometres downstream) with a terminal structure of the Kota Barrage (28 kilometres further downstream) in Rajasthan for irrigation.
6. Rihand
Rihand Dam is the largest dam of India by volume. Its reservoir is called Govind Ballabh Pant Sagar and is India's largest artificial lake. It is a concrete gravity dam located at Pipri in Sonbhadra district in Uttar Pradesh, India.
7. Sardar Sarovar
The Sardar Sarovar Dam is a concrete gravity dam built on the Narmada River in Navagam near the town of Kevadiya, Narmada District, in the state of Gujarat, India. The dam was constructed to provide water and electricity to four Indian states: Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and Rajasthan.
8. Nagarjuna Sagar
Nagarjuna Sagar Dam is a masonry dam across the Krishna River at Nagarjuna Sagar which straddles the border between Palnadu district in Andhra Pradesh and Nalgonda district in Telangana. The dam provides irrigation water to the districts of Palnadu, Guntur, Nalgonda, Prakasam, Khammam, Krishna, and parts of West Godavari. It is also a source of electricity generation for the national grid. [Refer Fig. 4]

Objective:To identify the soil types.Classification of SoilsIndia has varied relief features, landforms, climatic realms and vegetation types. These have contributed to the development of various types of soils.The soils types are1. Alluvial Soils:                                                                                                                                                                              Fig. 1: Alluvial Soils    This is the most widely spread and important soil. In fact, the entire northern plains are made of alluvial soil. These have been deposited by three important Himalayan river systems – the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra. These soils also extend in Rajasthan and Gujarat through a narrow corridor. Alluvial soil is also found in the eastern coastal plains particularly in the deltas of the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri rivers. The alluvial soil consists of various proportions of sand, silt and clay. [Refer Fig. 1]2. Black Soil:                                                                                                                                                                                 Fig. 2: Black SoilThese soils are black in colour and are also known as regur soils. Black soil is ideal for growing cotton and is also known as black cotton soil. It is believed that climatic conditions along with the parent rock material are the important factors for the formation of black soil. This type of soil is typical of the Deccan trap (Basalt) region spread over northwest Deccan plateau and is made up of lava flows. They cover the plateaus of Maharashtra, Saurashtra, Malwa, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and extend in the south east direction along the Godavari and the Krishna valleys. [Refer Fig. 2]3. Laterite Soil:                                                                                                                                                                                 Fig. 3: Laterite SoilLaterite has been derived from the Latin word ‘later’ which means brick. The laterite soil develops under tropical and subtropical climate with alternate wet and dry seasons. This soil is the result of intense leaching due to heavy rain. Lateritic soils are mostly deep to very deep, acidic, generally deficient in plant nutrients and occur mostly in southern states, Western Ghats region of Maharashtra, Odisha, some parts of West Bengal and North-east regions. [Refer Fig. 3]4. Arid Soils:                                                                                                                                                                                           Fig. 4: Arid SoilArid soils range from red to brown in colour. They are generally sandy in texture and saline in nature. In some areas the salt content is very high and common salt is obtained by evaporating the water. Due to the dry climate, high temperature, evaporation is faster and the soil lacks humus and moisture. The lower horizons of the soil are occupied by Kankar because of the increasing calcium content downwards. The Kankar layer formations in the bottom horizons restrict the infiltration of water. After proper irrigation these soils become cultivable as has been in the case of western Rajasthan. [Refer Fig. 4]5. Red and Yellow Soils:                                                                                                                                                                               Fig. 5: Red and Yellow SoilsRed soil develops on crystalline igneous rocks in areas of low rainfall in the eastern and southern parts of the Deccan plateau. Yellow and red soils are also found in parts of Odisha, Chhattisgarh, southern parts of the middle Ganga plain and along the piedmont zone of the Western Ghats. These soils develop a reddish colour due to diffusion of iron in crystalline and metamorphic rocks. It looks yellow when it occurs in a hydrated form.[Refer Fig. 5]6. Forest Soils:                                                                                                                                                                                        Fig. 6: Forest SoilThese soils are found in the hilly and mountainous areas where sufficient rain forests are available. The soil texture varies according to the mountain environment where they are formed. They are loamy and silty in valley sides and coarse grained in the upper slopes. In the snow covered areas of Himalayas, these soils experience denudation and are acidic with low humus content. The soils found in the lower parts of the valleys particularly on the river terraces and alluvial fans are fertile. [Refer Fig. 6]

Objective:To learn the distribution of minerals in India.Iron ore:Iron ore is the basic mineral and the backbone of industrial development. India is endowed with fairly abundant resources of good quality iron ore.Magnetite is the finest iron ore with a very hight iron content up to 70 percent. It has excellent magnetic qualities, especially valuable in the electrical industry.Hematite ore is the most important industrial iron ore in terms of the quantity used, but it has a slightly lower iron content than magnetite. (50-60 percent).In 2018–19, almost the entire production of iron ore (97%) accrued from Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, and Jharkhand. The remaining production (3%) was from other states.The major iron ore belts in India are:Odisha-Jharkhand belt in Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra.Durg-Bastar-Chandrapur.Ballari-Chitradurga-Chikkamagaluru-Tumakuru belt in Karnataka.Maharashtra-Goa belt.Manganese:Manganese is mainly used in the manufacturing of steel and ferro-manganese alloys.Nearly 10 kg of manganese is required to manufacture one tonne of steel. It is also used in manufacturing bleaching powder, insecticides, and paints.The following diagram shows state-wise production of manganese in percentage for the year 2018-19.                                                                                                                           Fig. 1: State-wise production of Manganese in percent for 2018-19Bauxite:Bauxite deposits are formed by the decomposition of a wide variety of rocks rich in aluminium silicates.India’s bauxite deposits are mainly found in the Amarkantak plateau, Maikal hills, and the plateau region of Bilaspur-Katni.Odisha was the largest bauxite producing state in India in 2016-17. Panchpatmali deposits in Koraput district are the most important bauxite deposits in the state.The following diagram shows state-wise production of bauxite in percentage for the year 2018-19                                                                                                                                 Fig. 2: State-wise production of Bauxite in percent for 2018-19Mica:Mica is a mineral made up of a series of plates or leaves. It splits easily into thin sheets. These sheets can be so thin that a thousand can be layered into a mica sheet of a few centimeters high.Mica can be clear, black, green, red, yellow or brown. Due to its excellent dielectric strength, low power loss factor, insulating properties and resistance to high voltage, mica is one of the most indispensable minerals used in electric and electronic industries.Mica deposits are found in the northern edge of the Chota Nagpur plateau. Koderma Gaya – Hazaribagh belt of Jharkhand is the leading producer.In Rajasthan, the major mica producing area is around Ajmer. Nellore mica belt of Andhra Pradesh is also an important producer in the country.Coal:In India, coal is the most abundantly available fossil fuel used for power generation, to supply energy to industry as well as for domestic needs.Coal is found in a variety of forms depending on the degrees of compression and the depth and time of burial.Lignite is a low grade brown coal, which is soft with high moisture content. The principal lignite reserves are in Neyveli in Tamil Nadu and are used for the generation of electricity.Coal that has been buried deep and subjected to increased temperatures is bituminous coal.Anthracite is the highest quality hard coal.In India, coal occurs in rock series of two main geological ages, Gondwana, a little over 200 million years in age and in tertiary deposits which are only about 55 million years old.The major resources of Gondwana coal are located in Damodar valley (West Bengal, Jharkhand). Jharia, Raniganj, Bokaro.Tertiary coals occur in the northeastern states of Meghalaya, Assam, Arunachal Pradesh and Nagaland.Mineral oil:Mineral oil is the next major energy source in India after coal.It provides fuel for heat and lighting, lubricants for machinery and raw materials for a number of manufacturing industries.Mumbai High, Gujarat and Assam are major petroleum production areas in India.Ankeleshwar is the most important oil field of Gujarat.Assam is the oldest oil producing state of India.Digboi, Naharkatiya and Moran-Hugrijan are the important oil fields in the state.

Objective:To introduce the concept of minerals and their types.MineralsMineral as a homogenous, naturally occurring substance with a definable internal structure. Minerals are usually found in 'ores'. The term ore is used to describe an accumulation of any mineral mixed with other elements. In sedimentary rocks a number of minerals occur in beds or layers. They have been formed as a result of deposition, accumulation and concentration in horizontal strata.Types of mineralsThere are three types of Minerals- Metallic, Non-metallic, Energy minerals. [Refer Fig. 1]                                                                                             Fig. 1: Classification of mineralsMetallic mineralsMetals are obtained by the extraction of these minerals. These are very valuable as they provide metals in pure form. Metallic minerals can be broadly categorised into ferrous minerals, non-ferrous minerals and precious minerals.Ferrous minerals: Those minerals are metallic minerals containing iron. Examples: Iron ore, Manganese, nickel, cobalt.Non-Ferrous minerals: Those minerals are metallic minerals not containing iron. Examples: Copper, lead, tin, bauxite. Bauxite is the mineral that is formed by the decomposition of rocks, leaving a residual mass of weathered material. Bauxite is an important ore that is chemically an oxide of aluminum. It is formed by both physical and chemical weathering.Non-Metallic MineralsThose minerals which do not contain metals are called non-metallic minerals. Examples: Mica, salt, potash, sulphur, granite, marble, limestone. Koderma, a district in Jharkhand, is known for being the leading producer of mica, especially ruby mica.Energy MineralsThose minerals which provide energy are called energy minerals. Examples: Coal, petroleum, natural gas.

Objective
To learn about the major crops and cultivation.
Crops
A cultivated plant that is grown on a large scale commercially and harvested extensively for profit or subsistence is known as a crop. India has three cropping seasons — rabi, kharif and zaid.
Rabi Crops
  Rabi crops are sown in winter from October to December and harvested in summer from April to June. Some of the important rabi crops are wheat, barley, peas, gram and mustard. Though, these crops are grown in large parts of India, states from the north and north-western parts such as Punjab, Haryana.
Kharif crops
   Kharif crops are grown with the onset of monsoon in different parts of the country and these are harvested in September-October. Important crops grown during this season are paddy, maize, jowar, bajra, tur (arhar), moong, urad, cotton, jute, groundnut and soybean. Some of the most important rice growing regions are Assam, West Bengal, coastal regions of Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Maharashtra.
Zaid Crops
   In between the rabi and the kharif seasons, there is a short season during the summer months known as the Zaid season. Some of the crops produced during ‘zaid’ are watermelon, muskmelon, cucumber, vegetables and fodder crops.
Major Crops
A variety of food and non food crops are grown in different parts of the country depending upon the variations in soil, climate and cultivation practices. Major crops grown in India are rice, wheat, millets, pulses, tea, coffee, sugarcane, oil seeds, cotton and jute, etc.
1. Rice
    It is the staple food crop of a majority of the people in India. Our country is the second largest producer of rice in the world after China. It is a kharif crop which requires high temperature, (above 25°C) and high humidity with annual rainfall above 100 cm. In the areas of less rainfall, it grows with the help of irrigation. [Refer Fig. 1]
                                                              
                                                                         Fig. 1: Rice Cultivation
2. Wheat
    This is the second most important cereal crop. It is the main food crop, in north and north-western part of the country. This rabi crop requires a cool growing season and a bright sunshine at the time of ripening. It requires 50 to 75 cm of annual rainfall evenlydistributed over the growing season. [Refer Fig. 2]
                                                            
                                                                        Fig. 2: Wheat Cultivation
3. Maize
     It is a crop which is used both as food and fodder. It is a kharif crop which requires temperature between 21°C to 27°C and grows well in old alluvial soil. In some states like Bihar maize is grown in rabi season also. Use of modern inputs such as HYV seeds, fertilisers and irrigation have contributed to the increasing production of maize. Major maize-producing states are Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. [Refer Fig. 3]
                                                            
                                                                        Fig. 3: Maize Cultivation
4. Sugarcane
      It is a tropical as well as a subtropical crop. It grows well in hot and humid climate with a temperature of 21°C to 27°C and an annual rainfall between 75cm. and 100cm. Irrigation is required in the regions of low rainfall. It can be grown on a variety of soils and needs manual labour from sowing to harvesting. [Refer Fig. 4]
                                                           
                                                                   Fig. 4: Sugarcane Cultivation
5. Tea
      Tea cultivation is an example of plantation agriculture. It is also an important beverage crop introduced in India initially by the British. Today, most of the tea plantations are owned by Indians. The tea plant grows well in tropical and sub-tropical climates endowed with deep and fertile well-drained soil, rich in humus and organic matter. Major teaproducing states are Assam, hills of Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri districts, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Apart from these, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Meghalaya, Andhra Pradesh. [Refer Fig. 5]

Objective:
To describe different types of natural vegetation in India.
Theory
         Our country India is one of the 12 mega bio-diversity countries of the world. With about 47,000 plant species India occupies tenth place in the world and fourth in Asia in plant diversity. There are about 15,000 flowering plants in India, which account for 6 per cent in the world’s total number of flowering plants. The country has many nonflowering plants, such as ferns, algae and fungi.
Natural vegetation refers to a plant community, which has grown naturally without human aid and has been left undisturbed by humans for a long time. This is termed as a virgin vegetation. Thus, cultivated crops and fruits, orchards form part of vegetation but not natural vegetation. The term flora is used to denote plants of a particular region or period.
Types of vegetation
Tropical Evergreen Forests
Tropical Deciduous Forests
Montane Forests
Tropical Thorn Forests
Mangrove Forests
Tropical Evergreen Forests:
These forests are restricted to heavy rainfall areas of the Western Ghats and the island groups of Lakshadweep, Andaman and Nicobar, upper parts of Assam and Tamil Nadu coast. They are at their best in areas having more than 200 cm of rainfall with a short dry season. The trees reach great heights up to 60 metres or even above. Since the region is warm and wet throughout the year, it has a luxuriant vegetation of all kinds — trees, shrubs and creepers giving it a multilayered structure. [Refer Fig. 1]
                                                             
                                                                      Fig. 1: Tropical evergreen forests
Tropical Deciduous Forests:
These are the most widespread forests of India. They are also called the monsoon forests and spread over the region receiving rainfall between 200 cm and 70 cm. Trees of this forest type shed their leaves for about six to eight weeks in dry summer. On the basis of the availability of water, these forests are further divided into moist and dry deciduous. The former is found in areas receiving rainfall between 200 and 100 cm. These forests exist, therefore, mostly in the eastern part of the country — northeastern states, along the foothills of the Himalayas, Jharkhand, West Odisha and Chhattisgarh, and on the eastern slopes of the Western Ghats.The dry deciduous forests are found in areas having rainfall between 100 cm and 70 cm. These forests are found in the rainier parts of the Peninsular plateau and the plains of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. [Refer Fig. 2]
                                                               
                                                                         Fig. 2: Tropical deciduous forests
Montane Forests:
In mountainous areas, the decrease in temperature with increasing altitude leads to the corresponding change in natural vegetation. As such, there is a succession of natural vegetation belts in the same order as we see from the tropical to the tundra region. The wet temperate type of forests are found between a height of 1000 and 2000 metres. Evergreen broad-leaf trees, such as oaks and chestnuts predominate. Between 1500 and 3000 metres, temperate forests containing coniferous trees, like pine, deodar, silver fir, spruce and cedar, are found. These forests cover mostly the southern slopes of the Himalayas, places having high altitude in southern and north-east India. [Refer Fig. 3]
                                                                
                                                                                Fig. 3: Montane forests
Tropical Thorn Forests:
In regions with less than 70 cm of rainfall, the natural vegetation consists of thorny trees and bushes. This type of vegetation is found in the north-western part of the country, including semi-arid areas of Gujarat, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. Acacias, palms, euphorbias and cacti are the main plant species. Trees are scattered and have long roots penetrating deep into the soil in order to get moisture. The stems are succulent to conserve water. Leaves are mostly thick and small to minimise evaporation. These forests give way to thorn forests and scrubs in arid areas. [Refer Fig. 4]
                                                        
                                                                         Fig. 4: The Thorn Forests and Scrubs
Mangrove Forests:
The mangrove tidal forests are found in the areas of coasts influenced by tides. Mud and silt get accumutated on such coasts. Dense mangroves are the common varieties with roots of the plants submerged under water. The deltas of the Ganga, the Mahanadi, the Krishna, the Godavari and the Kaveri are covered by such vegetation. In the Ganga-Brahmaputra delta, sundari trees are found, which provide durable hard timber. Palm, coconut, keora, agar, etc., also grow in some parts of the delta. [Refer Fig. 5]

Objective:
To know about major rivers and lakes of India.
Rivers
   Indian rivers are majorly divided into two groups based on source of origin.
Himalayan rivers.
Peninsular rivers.
  The Himalayan Rivers
Most of the Himalayan rivers are perennial. It means that they have water throughout the year.
These rivers receive water from rain as well as from melted snow from the lofty mountains.
The major Himalayan rivers are the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra.
  The Indus River
The river Indus rises in Tibet, near Lake Mansarowar.
Flowing west, it enters India in the Ladakh.
According to the regulations of the Indus Water Treaty (1960), India can use only 20 per cent of the total water carried by the Indus river system.
  The Ganga River
The headwaters of the Ganga, called the ‘Bhagirathi’ is fed by the Gangotri Glacier and joined by the Alaknanda at Devaprayag in Uttarakhand.
At Haridwar, the Ganga emerges from the mountains on to the plains.
The Ganga is joined by many tributaries from the Himalayas, a few of them being major rivers, such as the Yamuna, the Ghaghara, the Gandak and the Kosi.
The river Yamuna rises from the Yamunotri Glacier in the Himalayas.
The Namami Gange Programme is an Integrated Conservation Mission approved as a ‘flagship programme’ by the Union Government in June 2014 to accomplish the twin objectives of effective abatement of pollution, conservation and rejuvenation of the national river, Ganga.
  The Brahmaputra River
The Brahmaputra rises in Tibet east of Mansarowar lake very close to the sources of the Indus and the Satluj.
It is slightly longer than the Indus, and most of its course lies outside India.
It flows eastwards parallel to the Himalayas.
Brahmaputra is known as the Tsang Po in Tibet and Jamuna in Bangladesh.
  The Peninsular Rivers
The main water divide in Peninsular India is formed by the Western Ghats, which runs from north to south close to the western coast.
Most of the major rivers of the Peninsula, such as the Mahanadi, the Godavari, the Krishna and the Kaveri flow eastwards and drain into the Bay of Bengal and make deltas at their mouths.
The Narmada and the Tapi are the only long rivers, which flow west and make esturies.
  The Narmada Basin
The Narmada rises in the Amarkantak hills in Madhya Pradesh.
It flows towards the west in a rift valley formed due to faulting.
The Narmada river conservation mission has been undertaken by the government of Madhya Pradesh by a scheme named Namami Devi Narmade.
  The Tapi Basin
The Tapi rises in the Satpura ranges, in the Betul district of Madhya Pradesh.
It also flows in a rift valley parallel to the Narmada but it is much shorter in length.
Its basin covers parts of Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Maharashtra.
  The Godavari Basin
The Godavari is the largest Peninsular river.
It rises from the slopes of the Western Ghats in the Nasik district of Maharashtra.
Its length is about 1500 km.
It drains into the Bay of Bengal. Its drainage basin is also the largest among the peninsular rivers.
  The Mahanadi Basin
The Mahanadi rises in the highlands of Chhattisgarh.
It flows through Odisha to reach the Bay of Bengal.
The length of the river is about 860 km.
  The Krishna Basin
Rising from a spring near Mahabaleshwar, the Krishna flows for about 1400 km and reaches the Bay of Bengal.
The Tungabhadra, the Koyana, the Ghatprabha, the Musi and the Bhima are some of its tributaries.
  The Kaveri Basin
The Kaveri rises in the Brahmagri range of the Western Ghats and it reaches the Bay of Bengal in south of Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu.
The total length of the river is about 760 km.
Its main tributaries are Amravati, Bhavani, Hemavati and Kabini.
The river Kaveri makes the second biggest waterfall in India, known as Shivasamudram Falls.
Lakes
A lake is a large water body surrounded by land. There are some lakes which are the result of the action of glaciers and ice sheets, while others have been formed by wind, river action and human activities.
Freshwater lakes.
Saltwater lakes.
  Freshwater lakes
Most of the freshwater lakes are in the Himalayan region. They are of glacial origin.
In other words, they formed when glaciers dug out a basin, which was later filled with snowmelt.
The Wular lake in Jammu and Kashmir, in contrast, is the result of tectonic activity. It is the largest freshwater lake in India.
The Dal lake, Bhimtal, Nainital, Loktak and Barapani are some other important freshwater lakes.
  Saltwater lakes
Lakes in the region of inland drainage are sometimes seasonal.
the Sambhar lake in Rajasthan, which is a saltwater lake.
Its water is used for producing salt.

Objective:
To gain knowledge of the bird sanctuary, national park, and wildlife sanctuary.
India's Wildlife
India is also rich in its fauna. It has approximately 90,000 animal species. The country has about 2,000 species of birds. They constitute 13% of the world’s total. There are 2,546 species of fish, which account for nearly 12% of the world’s stock. It also shares between 5 and 8 per cent of the world’samphibians, reptiles and mammals
The elephants are the most majestic animals among the mammals. They are found in the hot wet forests of Assam, Karnataka and Kerala. One-horned rhinoceroses are the other animals
Dachigam national park (Srinagar, Jammu kashmir):
Dachigam National Park is located 22 km (kilometer) from Srinagar in Jammu and Kashmir. It covers an area of 141 sq km (square kilometer). The name literally stands for ‘ten villages’, which could be in memory of the ten villages that were relocated in order to create the park. [Refer Fig. 1]
                                                      
                                                                   Fig. 1: Dachigam national park
Rajaji national park (Uttarakhand):
Rajaji National Park is situated in the state of Uttarakhand, now known as Uttarakhand. The picturesque beauty and rich biodiversity of the park serve as its major attractions for both nature lovers as well as wildlife enthusiasts. In the year 1983, Rajaji Wildlife Sanctuary of Uttaranchal was merged with Motichur and Chilla wildlife sanctuaries and made into Rajaji National Park. The park has been named after Late Shri C. Rajgopalachari (also known as Rajaji), a famous freedom fighter and first governor general of India Rajaji National Park of India spreads over an area of 820.42 sq. km. and is open to visitors only from Mid-November to Mid-June. [Refer Fig. 2]
                                                                
                                                                                Fig. 2: Rajaji national park
Sariska national park (Rajasthan):
The most attractive aspect of Sariska Tiger Reserve are its Bengal tigers. While there were more than 16 tigers reported before 2005, rampant poaching and hunting led to a horrendous decline. A two-month investigative probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation and Rajasthan Forest Department in 2011 revealed that there wasn’t a single tiger left in the park. [Refer Fig. 3]
                                                              
                                                                           Fig. 3: Sariska national park
Kaziranga national park (Nagaon District of Assam):
Kaziranga National Park lies partly in Golaghat District and partly in Nagaon District of Assam. It is the oldest park in Assam covering an area of 430 Sq kms along the river Brahmaputra on the North and the Karbi Anglong hills on the South. Kaziranga National Park is one of the last areas in eastern India undisturbed by a human presence. It is inhabited by the world's largest population of one-horned rhinoceroses, as well as many mammals, including tigers, elephants, panthers and bears, and thousands of birds. [Refer Fig. 4]
                                                             
                                                                          Fig. 4: Kaziranga national park
Tadoba national park (Maharashtra):

It lies in the Chandrapur district of Maharashtra state and is approximately 150 km from Nagpur city. The total area of the tiger reserve is 1,727 Sq.km, which includes the Tadoba National Park, created in the year 1955. The Andhari Wildlife Sanctuary was formed in the year 1986 and was amalgamated with the park in 1995 to establish the present Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve. The word 'Tadoba' is derived from the name of God "Tadoba" or "Taru," which is praised by local tribal people of this region and "Andhari" is derived from the name of Andhari river that flows in this area. [Refer Fig. 5]
                                                      
                                                                     Fig. 5: Tadoba national park

Objective:To introduce the concept of resources and their types.ResourcesAll materials available in our environment which satisfy our needs called the resources.Types of resourcesThere are three types of resources: Natural resources, Human made resources and Human resources. [Refer Fig. 1]                                                                                                                                                 Fig. 1: Classification of resourcesNatural ResourcesThe resources which are drawn from nature and used without much modification are known as natural resources. Natural resources can be broadly categorized into renewable and non-renewable resources.Renewable resources: Renewable resources are those which get renewed or replenished very quickly. Some of these are unlimited which are not affected by human activities. Examples: Solar energy, Wind energy, Water.Non-renewable resources: Non-renewable resources are those which have limited stock. Once the stock is exhausted it may take thousands of years to be renewed and replenished. Examples: Coal, Nuclear energy, Sunflower oil, Petroleum.Human-made resourcesWhen the original form of natural resources is changed by human being to make it more useful, then it is called man-made resource or human-made resource. Examples: Building, Bridges, Roads, Vehicles.Human resourcesPeople are human resources. Education and health help to make people a valuable resource.

Objective:
         To explain the process of water cycle and relate the changes of states of water in different phases.
Water Cycle
          The sun’s heat causes the evaporation of water into vapour. When the water vapour cools down, it condenses and forms clouds. From there, it may fall on land or sea in the form of rain, snow, or sleet. The process by which water continually changes its form and circulates between oceans, the atmosphere, and land is known as the water cycle. [Refer Fig. 1]
                                                             
                                                                               Fig. 1: Water cycle
Processes involved in the water cycle:
          The four major processes that are involved in the water cycle are evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and surface run-off.
1. Evaporation
          Evaporation is the process by which water transforms from a liquid to gas or vapour due to heat.
2. Condensation
          Condensation is the process in which water vapour in the air cools down and changes back into liquid droplets to form clouds.
3. Precipitation
          The process in which once the water vapour condenses to form liquid droplets, they fall to the ground in various forms such as rain, snow, or sleet.
4. Surface Run-Off
        After rainfall, the excess water either infiltrates the ground or remains on the land’s surface and is called surface water.
Distribution of water bodies
About three-fourth of the earth's surface is covered by water.
Even if there is more water than land on this earth, the reason so many countries face water scarcity is the amount of fresh water available to us out of total water available is very less and rest is saline water which is not fit for consumption.
The following table gives the distribution of water in percentage.

Objective:
To explain tides and their relationship with the Earth, Sun, and Moon.
Tides:
The rhythmic rise and fall of ocean water twice in a day is called a tide.
It is high tide when the water covers much of the shore by rising to its highest level.
It is low tide when the water falls to its lowest level and recedes from the shore.
The strong gravitational pull exerted by the Sun and the Moon on the Earth’s surface causes the tides.
Tides based on the Sun, Moon, and Earth positions:
The height of rising water (high tide) varies appreciably depending upon the position of the Sun and Moon on the Earth.
Spring tides and neap tides fall under this category.
Spring tides:
The position of both the Sun and the Moon with respect to the Earth has a direct bearing on tide height.
When the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth are in a straight line, the height of the tide will be higher.
These are called spring tides, and they occur twice a month, one during the full Moon period and another during the new Moon period. [Refer Fig. 1]
                                                              
                                                                                     Fig. 1: Spring tide
Neap tide:
When the Moon is in its first and last quarter, the ocean waters get drawn in diagonally opposite directions by the gravitational pull of the Sun and the Moon resulting in low tides.
These tides are called neap tides. [Refer Fig. 2]
                                                               
                                                                                        Fig. 2: Neap tide
Why are tides important?
High tides help in navigation. They raise the water level close to the shores. This helps the ships to arrive at the harbour more easily.
The high tides also help in fishing. Many more fish come closer to the shore during the high tide. This enables fishermen to get a plentiful catch.
The rise and fall of water due to tides is being used to generate electricity in some places.

Objective:
To know about Seas, Lakes and Rivers of the world.
Oceans, seas and rivers are the Earth’s prized assets, influencing the survival of flora and fauna, as well as sustaining organisms and all living creatures alike. The first civilisations were shaped by the presence of these resources, and these bodies of water have also been key factors in the progress of trade and geographic exploration.
There are various hypotheses for the origins of water on Earth.
One widely held view is that the atmosphere and the oceans accumulated gradually over millennia with the “degassing” of the interior of the Earth: Water vapour escaping from the molten rocks of the early Earth condensed into rain and filled the basins that are our oceans.
Another theory suggests that the oceans could not form out of the protoplanetary disk because it was much too hot for water to condense. Instead, water was delivered to Earth by impacts from icy planetesimals originating at a distance from the Sun where ice could form.
What is a Sea?
The word “Sea” is also used to denote smaller, partly landlocked sections of the ocean and certain large, entirely landlocked, saltwater lakes, such as the Caspian Sea, the North Sea, the Red Sea, and the Dead Sea. These water bodies contain minerals like salts of magnesium, calcium, and potassium, amongst many other elements – some in minute concentrations.
What is a Lake?
A lake is a body of water surrounded on all sides by land. Lake water is still or standing, meaning it doesn't flow from point A to point B in the same way a river's does. Since they are often fed by rivers, springs or precipitation (a.k.a. rain and snow), lakes are primarily freshwater.
What is a River?
A river is a large, flowing water body that merges into a sea or an ocean. The tributaries of a river are known as streams, creeks and brooks. Rivers are part of the hydrological cycle. The water in rivers comes from precipitation through a drainage basin, surface runoff, and other sources such as groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpack.

Objective:
To gain knowledge about external forces acting on Earth and its consequent landform.
Landforms caused by rivers:
The running water in the river erodes the landscape.
A waterfall is created when a river flows at a steep angle over extremely hard rocks or down a steep valley side. [Refer Fig. 1]
                                                                        
                                                                                   Fig. 1: Waterfall
As the river enters the plain, it twists and turns, forming large bends known as meanders.
Due to continuous erosion and deposition along the sides of the meander, the ends of the meander loop come closer and closer. Eventually, the meander loop cuts off from the river and forms a cut-off lake, also called an ox-bow lake. [Refer Fig. 2]
                                                                              
                                                                      Fig. 2: Meanders and ox-bow lakes
Landforms caused by sea waves:
The erosion and deposition of the sea waves give rise to coastal landforms.
Seawaves continuously strike the rocks, and thus cracks develop. Over the time, cracks become larger and wider. Thus, hollow-like caves are formed on the rocks, called as sea caves. [Refer Fig. 3]
                                                                              
                                                                            Fig. 3: Sea arch and sea cave
As these cavities become bigger and bigger only the roof of the caves remain, thus forming sea arches.
Further erosion breaks the roof, and only walls are left, called stacks.
Landforms caused by glaciers:
Glaciers are “rivers of ice” which too erode the landscape by bulldozing soil and stones to expose the solid rock.
The material carried by the glacier such as rocks big and small, sand and silt gets deposited. These deposits form glacial moraines. [Refer Fig. 4]
                                                                                
                                                                                  Fig. 4: Glacier moraines
Landforms caused by wind:
An active agent of erosion and deposition in the deserts is wind.
In desert winds erode the lower section of the rock more than the upper part, leaving rocks have narrower base and wider top, such rocks are commonly called as mushroom rocks.
When the wind blows, it lifts and transports sand from one place to another and gets deposited in low hill – like structures called as sand dunes. [Refer Fig. 5]
When the grains of sand are very fine and light, the wind can carry and deposit it over very long distances. When such sand is deposited in large areas, it is called loess.

Objective:To identify the main layers of the Earth's atmosphere.What is the atmosphere?An atmosphere is the layer of gases surrounding a planet. Earth's atmosphere is composed of about 78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, and 1% other gases. The atmosphere extends up to a height of about 1,600 kilometres.Structure of the atmosphere:The atmosphere is divided into five layers starting from the earth’s surface based on composition, temperature, and other properties. These are the Troposphere, Stratosphere, Mesosphere, Thermosphere, and Exosphere. [Refer Fig. 1]                                                                                                                                                    Fig. 1: Layers of the atmosphereTroposphereThis layer is the most important layer of the Earth's atmosphere. Its average height is 13 kilometres. The air we breathe exists here. The troposphere is the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere. Most of the mass (about 75-80%) of the atmosphere is in the troposphere. Most types of clouds are found in the troposphere, and almost all weather occurs within this layer. A hot air balloon flies in the troposphere.StratosphereAbove the troposphere lies the stratosphere. It extends up to a height of 50 kilometres. This layer is almost free from clouds and associated weather phenomena, making conditions ideal for flying aeroplanes. One important feature of the stratosphere is that it contains a layer of ozone gas. We have just learned how it protects us from the harmful effects of the sun's rays.MesosphereThis is the third layer of the atmosphere. It lies above the stratosphere. It extends up to a height of 80 kilometres. Meteorites burn up in this layer upon entering from space.ThermosphereIn the thermosphere, temperature rises very rapidly with increasing height. The ionosphere is a part of this layer. It extends between 80-400 kilometres. This layer helps with radio transmission. In fact, radio waves transmitted from the earth are reflected back to the earth by this layer. Astronauts fly in the thermosphere.ExosphereThe uppermost layer of the Earth's atmosphere is known as the exosphere. This layer has very thin air. Light gases like helium and hydrogen float into space from here. It extends from about 400 kilometres. Most satellites orbit in the exosphere.
