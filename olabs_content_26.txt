Objective:
To identify the world's continents and oceans.
Continents
          The solid portion of the earth is called the lithosphere. It comprises the rocks of the earth’s crust and the thin layers of soil that contain nutrient elements that sustain organisms. There are two main divisions of the earth’s surface. The large land masses are known as the continents, and the huge bodies of water are called the ocean basins. All the oceans of the world are connected with one another. [Refer Fig. 1]
                                                  
                                                                      Fig. 1: World continents and oceans
            There are seven major continents. These are separated by large water bodies. These continents are Asia, Europe, Africa, North America, South America, Australia, and Antarctica.
Asia is the largest continent. It covers about one-third of the total land area of the earth. The continent lies in the Eastern Hemisphere. The Tropic of Cancer passes through this continent. Asia is separated from Europe by the Ural Mountains on the west.
Europe is much smaller than Asia. The continent lies to the west of Asia. The Arctic Circle passes through it. It is bound by water bodies on three sides.
Africa is the second-largest continent after Asia. The Equator, or 0° latitude, runs almost through the middle of the continent. A large part of Africa lies in the northern hemisphere. It is the only continent through which the Tropic of Cancer, the Equator, and the Tropic of Capricorn pass.
North America is the third-largest continent in the world. It is linked to South America by a very narrow strip of land called the Isthmus of Panama. The continent lies completely in the northern and western hemispheres.
South America lies mostly in the southern hemisphere. The Andes, the world's longest mountain range, runs through its length from north to south. South America has the world’s largest river, the Amazon.
Australia is the smallest continent that lies entirely in the Southern Hemisphere. It is surrounded on all sides by oceans and seas. It is called an island continent.
Antarctica completely in the Southern Hemisphere, is a huge continent. The South Pole lies almost at the center of this continent. As it is located in the South Polar Region, it is permanently covered with thick ice sheets.
Oceans
            Oceans are the major part of the hydrosphere. They are all interconnected. The ocean waters are always moving. The three chief movements of ocean waters are the waves, the tides, and the ocean currents.
The five major oceans are the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the Southern Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean.
The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean. It is spread over one-third of the earth. The Mariana Trench, the deepest part of the earth, lies in the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific Ocean is almost circular in shape. Asia, Australia, and the North and South Americas surround it.
Atlantic Ocean is the second largest ocean in the world. It is 'S' shaped. It is flanked by North and South Americas on the western side, and Europe and Africa on the eastern side. The coastline of the Atlantic Ocean is highly indented.
Indian Ocean is the only ocean named after a country, that being India. The shape of the ocean is almost triangular. In the north, it is bound by Asia, in the west by Africa, and in the east by Australia.
Southern Ocean encircles the continent of Antarctica and extends northward to 60 degrees south latitude.
Arctic Ocean is located within the Arctic Circle and surrounds the North Pole. It is connected with the Pacific Ocean by a narrow stretch of shallow water known as Berring Strait. It is bound by the northern coasts of North America and Eurasia.

Objective:     To identify the physical divisions of India.Physical Division of India        India is marked by a diversity of physical features. On the basis of the physical features, India can be divided into following physical divisions.Mountain/Hill RangesMountain RegionPlateau RegionPlain Region1. Mountain/Hill Ranges and Mountain Region:              Standing as sentinels in the north are the lofty snow-capped Himalayas. Him+alaya mean ‘the abode of snow’. The Himalayan mountains are divided into three main parallel ranges. The northernmost is the Great Himalaya or Himadri. The world’s highest peaks are located in this range. Middle Himalaya or Himachal lies to the south of Himadri. Many popular hill stations are situated here. The Shiwalik is the southernmost range. [Refer Fig. 1]2. Plateau Region:              To the south of plain region lies the plateau region. It is triangular in shape. The relief is highly uneven. This is a region with numerous hill ranges and valleys. Aravali hills, one of the oldest ranges of the world, border it on the north-west side. The Vindhyas and the Satpuras are the important ranges. The rivers Narmada and Tapi flow through these ranges. These are westflowing rivers that drain into the Arabian Sea. The Western Ghats or Sahyadris border the plateau in the west and the Eastern Ghats provide the eastern boundary. While the Western Ghats are almost continuous, the Eastern Ghats are broken and uneven. The plateau is rich in minerals like coal and iron-ore. [Refer Fig. 2]3. Plain Region:                 The Northern Indian plains lie to the south of the Himalayas. They are generally level and flat. These are formed by the alluvial deposits laid down by the rivers– the Indus, the Ganga, the Brahmaputra and their tributaries. These river plains provide fertile land for cultivation. That is the reason for high concentration of population in these plains. [Refer Fig. 3]

Objective:
To learn about the maps and its types.
Maps
A map is a representation or a drawing of the earth’s surface or a part of it drawn on a flat surface according to a scale. We find that maps are useful to us for various purposes. One map shows a small area and a few facts. Another map may contain as many facts as a big book. When many maps are put together we get an Atlas. Atlases are of various sizes, measurements drawn on different scales. Maps provide more information than a globe. They are of different types. Some of them are described below.
Physical Map
Political Map
Thematic Map
1. Physical Map
Maps showing natural features of the earth such as mountains, plateaus, plains, rivers, oceans etc. are called physical or relief maps. [Refer Fig. 1]
                                                                     
                                                                                            Fig. 1: Physical Map
2. Political Map
Maps showing cities, towns and villages, and different countries and states of the world with their boundaries are called political maps. [Refer Fig. 2]
                                                                    
                                                                                             Fig. 2: Political Map
3. Thematic Map
Some maps focus on specific information; such as road maps, rainfall maps, maps showing distribution of forests, industries etc. are known as thematic maps. Suitable titles are given on the basis of information provided in these maps. [Refer Fig. 3]

Objective:
To learn about latitudes and longitudes.
Latitude:
Latitude is a coordinate that specifies the north–south position of a point on the surface of the Earth or another celestial body.
Latitude is given as an angle that ranges from –90° at the south pole to 90° at the north pole, with 0° at the equator.
Equator:
The equator is an imaginary circular line and is a very important reference point to locate places on the earth. All parallel circles from the equator up to the poles are called parallels of latitudes. Latitudes are measured in degrees.
The equator represents the zero degree latitude. Since the distance from the equator to either of the poles is one-fourth of a circle round the earth, it will measure ¼th of 360 degrees, i.e. 90°. Thus, 90 degrees north latitude marks the North Pole and 90 degrees south latitude marks the South Pole. [Refer Fig. 1]
                                                             
                                                                                 Fig. 1: Longitude
Important parallels of Latitudes:
Besides the equator (0°), the North Pole (90°N) and the South Pole (90° S), there are four important parallels of latitudes. [Refer Fig. 1.2]
                                                                  
                                                                     Fig. 1.2: Important parallels of latitudes
Tropic of Cancer 23½° north in the Northern Hemisphere.
Tropic of Capricorn 23½° South in the Southern Hemisphere.
Arctic Circle at 66½° north of the equator.
Antarctic Circle at 66½° south of the equator.
Longitude:
Longitude is a geographical concept that refers to the angular distance, measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds, between a specific location on Earth and the Prime Meridian. The Prime Meridian is an imaginary line that runs from the North Pole to the South Pole and passes through Greenwich, London, in the United Kingdom. It serves as the reference point for measuring longitude.
Longitude is used to determine the east-west position of a place on the Earth's surface. The measurement starts from 0 degrees at the Prime Meridian and ranges up to 180 degrees both east and west. The 180-degree line opposite the Prime Meridian is known as the International Date Line.
The longitude lines, also called meridians, are drawn on maps and globes to create a grid system that helps identify and locate specific points on Earth accurately. Each meridian represents a specific longitude value, and the lines are evenly spaced from the Prime Meridian. [Refer Fig. 1.3]
                                                                     
                                                                                      Fig. 1.3: Longitudes

Objective:
  To gain and apply knowledge about different components of map such as distance, directions and symbols.
There are three components of map
Distance
Direction
Symbol
Distance:
While drawing a map, a small distance on paper represents a large distance on the ground.
Therefore, a scale is chosen for this purpose. Scale is the ratio between the actual distance on the ground and the distance shown on the map.
When large areas like continents or countries are to be shown on paper, then we use a small scale i.e. 4 cm on the map shows 400 km. of the ground. Such maps are called a small-scale map.
When a small area like your village or town is to be shown on paper, then we use a large scale i.e. 4 cm on the map showing 400 meters only on the ground. Such maps are called a large-scale map.
Large-scale maps give more information than small scale maps.
Direction:
Almost all maps contain an arrow marked with the letter ‘N’ at the upper right-hand corner. This arrow shows the north direction. It is called as North line.
With the help of this, other directions can also be found out. There are four major directions North, South, East and West,  these are also called cardinal points.
The other four intermediate directions are north-east (NE), south- east(SE), south-west (SW) and north-west (NW). [Refer Fig. 1]
                                                         
                                                                          Fig. 1: Cardinal directions
We can find out the direction of a place with the help of a compass. It is an instrument used to find out the main directions. Its magnetic needle always points in the north-south direction. [Refer Fig. 2]
                                                           
                                                                                 Fig. 2: A Compass
Symbol:
It is the third important component of a map.
It is impossible to draw on a map the different features such as buildings, roads, bridges, trees, railway lines or a well of actual shape and size.
Thus, they are shown by using certain letters, shades, colours, pictures and lines. With the use of these symbols, maps can be drawn easily.
There is an international agreement regarding the use of these symbols. These are called conventional symbols. [Refer Fig. 3]
Various colours are used for the same purpose. For example, generally blue is used for showing water bodies, brown for mountain, yellow for plateau and green is used for plains.

Objective:
To explain how the movement of the Earth causes day and night.
Rotation
Rotation is the movement of the earth on its axis.
Revolution
The movement of the earth around the sun in a fixed path or orbit is called Revolution.
Orbital Plane:
The axis of the earth which is an imaginary line, makes an angle of 66½° with its orbital plane.
The plane formed by the orbit is known as the orbital plane. [Refer Fig. 1]
                                                                       
                                                       Fig. 1: Inclination of the Earth's axis and the orbital plane
Circle of Illumination:
The portion facing the sun experiences day while the other half away from the sun experiences night.
The circle that divides the day from night on the globe is called the circle of illumination.
This circle does not coincide with the axis. [Refer Fig. 2]
                                                                                
                                                                  Fig. 2: Day and Night on the Earth due to rotation   
Earthday:                                             
The earth takes about 24 hours to complete one rotation around its axis.
The period of rotation is known as the earthday. This is the daily motion of the earth.
What would happen if the earth did not rotate?
The portion of the earth facing the sun would always experience day, thus bringing continuous warmth to the region.
The other half would remain in darkness and be freezing cold all the time.
Life would not have been possible in such extreme conditions.

Objective:
To describe how the movement of Earth around the Sun causes seasons.
Revolution:
The movement of the earth around the sun in a fixed path or orbit is called Revolution.
Equator:
It is halfway between the north pole and the south pole, at 0 degrees latitude.
An equator divides the planet into a northern hemisphere and a southern hemisphere.
Seasons:
A year is usually divided into summer, winter, spring and autumn seasons.
Seasons change due to the change in the position of the earth around the sun.
                                          
                                                              Fig. 1: Revolution of the Earth and Seasons
Autumn:
Autumn occurs in the Northern Hemisphere around 23rd September and in the Southern Hemisphere around 21st March.
On 21st March and September 23rd, direct rays of the sun fall on the equator.
Earth's axis is neither tilted away from nor towards the Sun. So, the whole earth experiences equal days and equal nights.
This is called an equinox.
Spring:
Spring occurs in the Northern Hemisphere around 21st March and in the Southern Hemisphere around 23rd September.
On 21st March and September 23rd, direct rays of the sun fall on the equator.
Earth's axis is neither tilted away from nor towards the Sun. So, the whole earth experiences equal days and equal nights.
This is called an equinox.
Summer:
Summer occurs in the Northern Hemisphere around 21st June and in the Southern Hemisphere around 22nd December.
In summer season, days are longer than nights.
Winter:
Winter occurs in the Northern Hemisphere around 22nd December and in the Southern Hemisphere around 21st June.
In winter season, nights are longer than days.

Objective:
To know about the State Legislative Assembly, including its composition and functions.
Constituency
Every state in India has a Legislative Assembly.
Each state is divided into different areas, or constituencies.
MLA (Member of the Legislative Assembly)
From each constituency, the people elect one representative, who then becomes a Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA).
These MLAs belong to different political parties.
Majority and opposition parties
A political party whose MLAs have won more than half the number of constituencies in a state can be said to be in a majority.
The political party that has the majority is called the ruling party, and all other members are called the opposition.
Coalition
At times, the ruling party may not be a single party but a group of parties working together. This is called a coalition.
Chief Minister
The chief minister is the head of the government.
After the elections, the MLAs belonging to the ruling party will elect their leader, who will become the chief minister.
The chief minister then selects other people as ministers.
The chief minister and other ministers have the responsibility of running various government departments or ministries.
They have separate offices.
Governor
The governor is the head of the state.
The governor is appointed by the central government to ensure that the state government works within the rules and regulations of the Constitution.
After the elections, it is the governor of the state who appoints the chief minister and other ministers.
A Legislative Assembly
A Legislative Assembly is a place where all the MLAs, whether from the ruling party or from the opposition, meet to discuss various things.
Hence, some MLAs have dual responsibilities: one as an MLA and the other as a minister.
All the MLAs who gather together (assemble) in the legislative assembly are called the Legislature.
They are the ones who authorise and supervise their work.

Ward
Every village Panchayat is divided into wards, i.e. smaller areas.
Each ward elects a representative who is known as the Ward Member (Panch).
Gram Sabha
                                                       
                                                                                    Fig. 1: Gram Sabha
The Gram Sabha is a meeting of all adults who live in the area covered by a Panchayat.
This could be only one village or a few villages.
Anyone who is 18 years old or more and who has the right to vote is a member of the Gram Sabha.
All the members of the Gram Sabha also elect a Sarpanch who is the Panchayat President.
The Gram Sabha is a key factor in making the Gram Panchayat play its role and be responsible.
It is the place where all plans for the work of the Gram Panchayat are placed before the people.
The Gram Sabha prevents the Panchayat from doing wrong things like misusing money or favouring certain people.
It plays an important role in keeping an eye on the elected representatives and in making them responsible to the persons who elected them. [Refer Fig. 1]
Gram Panchayat
The Gram Panchayat is elected for five years.
The Gram Panchayat meets regularly and one of its main tasks is to implement developmental programmes for all villages that come under it.
It includes Sarpanch, Ward Members (Panchs) and the Secretary. The secretary is appointed by the government.
The work of the Gram Panchayat has to be approved by the Gram Sabha.
Role of Sarpanch
The head of the Panchayat is known as Sarpanch.
He/ she is elected by all members of a Panchayat.
He is the chairperson/Chairman of all Gram Sabha meetings.
Panch
From each ward one member is elected by the people of wards known as Panch.
Secretary
The Gram Panchayat has a Secretary who is also the Secretary of the Gram Sabha.
This person is not an elected person but is appointed by the government.
The Secretary is responsible for calling the meeting of the Gram Sabha and Gram Panchayat and keeping a record of the proceedings.
The work of a Gram Panchayat includes:
The construction and maintenance of water sources, roads, drainage, school buildings and other common property resources.
Levying and collecting local taxes.
Executing government schemes related to generating employment in the village.
Sources of funds for the Panchayat:
Collection of taxes on houses, market places.
Government scheme funds received through various departments of the government - through the Janpad and Zila Panchayats.
Donations for community works etc.

Objective:To gain the pyramid knowledge of egyptian pyramids and their significance.PyramidThe Pyramid complex is located on the outskirts of modern-day Cairo, Egypt, and is home to the Great Pyramid of Giza, which is the largest and most famous pyramid in the world. It was built as a tomb for the Pharaoh Khufu during the Old Kingdom period, around 2560 BC, and is estimated to have taken over 20 years to construct using a workforce of around 100,000 people. The primary material used for construction was limestone, sourced locally from the Giza Plateau. [Refer Fig. 1]The Great Pyramid of Giza stands over 146 meters tall and consists of over 2 million stone blocks, each weighing an average of 2.5 tons. The pyramid is aligned to true north and contains several interior chambers and corridors, including the King's Chamber and the Queen's Chamber. The King's Chamber houses the pharaoh's sarcophagus, while the Queen's Chamber may have been used for other funerary purposes. [Refer Fig. 2]                                                          Fig. 1: Pyramid                                                    Fig. 2: Interior of pyramidKing's Chamber:The King's Chamber is a large room located within the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. It is believed to have been built as the main burial chamber for the pharaoh Khufu, who commissioned the construction of the pyramid around 2550 BC. The chamber is located in the heart of the pyramid and is made of massive blocks of red granite, some of which weigh as much as 50 tons. The chamber contains a rectangular granite sarcophagus, which is believed to have been intended to hold the pharaoh's mummy. [Refer Fig. 3]                                                                                                                                                      Fig. 3: King's ChamberGrand Gallery:The Grand Gallery is a long and narrow passage within the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt. It is approximately 47 meters long (154 feet) and 8 meters high (26 feet) and is located between the ascending and descending passages that lead to the King's Chamber and the entrance of the pyramid. [Refer Fig. 4]                                                                                                                                               Fig. 4: Grand GalleryQueen's Chamber:The Queen's Chamber is a large room within the Great Pyramid of Giza in Egypt, located above the King's Chamber and below the Grand Gallery. It is approximately 19 meters long (62 feet), 5.2 meters wide (17 feet), and 6.1 meters high (20 feet). Queen's Chamber may have been used for other funerary purposes. [Refer Fig. 5]                                                                                                                                            Fig. 5: Queen's Chamber

Objective:
To enlist the names of different rulers of Delhi in chronological manner.
Theory
Delhi Sultans
         Under the Tomaras and Chauhans, Delhi became an important commercial centre. Delhi first became the capital of a kingdom under the Tomara Rajputs. Many rich Jaina merchants lived in the city and constructed several temples. Coins called dehliwal were minted here and had a wide circulation. Transformation of Delhi into a capital that controlled vast areas of the subcontinent started with the foundation of the Delhi Sultanate at the beginning of the 13th century.
Finding out about the Delhi Sultans
         Although inscriptions, coins and architecture provide a lot of information, especially valuable are “histories”, tarikh (singular)/tawarikh (plural), written in Persian, the language of administration under the Delhi Sultans. The authors of tawarikh were learned men: secretaries, administrators, poets and courtiers, who both recounted events and advised rulers on governance, emphasising the importance of just rule.

Objective:To enlist the different events of India after independence in a chronological manner.Major Events in India After Independence Year  Events  1947India gained independence from British rule after nearly 200 years of colonialism. The Indian Independence Act of 1947 led to the formation of two independent nations, India and Pakistan.  1949On November 26, 1949, the Constituent Assembly formally adopted the Constitution of India. This date is now commemorated annually as Constitution Day or National Law Day.Dr. B.R. Ambedkar, as the chairman of the drafting committee, played a pivotal role in formulating the Constitution of India. He is known as the "Father of the Indian Constitution".  1950January 26, 1950, marked a momentous occasion as India officially adopted its Constitution, becoming a sovereign democratic republic. This day is celebrated annually as Republic Day. The Constitution outlines the fundamental rights, duties, and governance framework for the country. Dr. Rajendra Prasad was elected as the first President of India.  1951The First Five-Year Plan, a blueprint for economic development and growth, was launched in 1951. The plan focused on agriculture, industries, infrastructure, and social services. It aimed to alleviate poverty and modernize the economy.  1952The first general elections, held in 1952. The Indian National Congress, led by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, emerged as the dominant party, winning a majority of seats in the Parliament.  1953The demand for a separate state of Andhra Pradesh, based on linguistic lines, gained momentum. This culminated in the formation of Andhra State on October 1, 1953, separating it from the Madras Presidency.  1956The implementation of the Five-Year Plans continued, focusing on economic growth, industrialization, and social development. The plans aimed to uplift underdeveloped regions, improve infrastructure, and address socio-economic disparities.  1960On May 1, 1960, the bilingual Bombay State was divided, leading to the creation of two separate states: Maharashtra and Gujarat. This division was based on linguistic considerations, as advocated in the States Reorganization Act of 1956.  1966In 1966, the state of Punjab was divided to create the new state of Haryana. The division was primarily based on linguistic and regional considerations.  1970During the 1970s, the membership of the non-aligned movement included a substantial portion of the developing world. Member countries from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and other regions joined the movement, seeking to maintain independence, sovereignty, and non-alignment with the major power blocs of the Cold War era.

Objective:        To understand the evolution of money.TheorySituation before money          In the early ages, Indians used grains and cattle as money. The system where two parties exchange grains and cattle as money is called the Barter system. The main disadvantage of the barter system is Double coincidence, where both parties have to agree to sell and buy each other’s commodities. Thereafter came the use of metallic coins - gold, silver, copper coins. [Refer Fig. 1]                                                                                                         Fig. 1: Mettalic coinsMoney as a Medium of Exchange         Money acts as an intermediate in the exchange process, it is called a medium of exchange. A person holding money can easily exchange it for any commodity or service that he or she might want.Modern form of money         Now, the modern forms of money include currency – paper notes and coins. The modern forms of money – currency and deposits – are closely linked to the workings of the modern banking system. It is authorised by the government of the country.                                              1. Currency           In India, the Reserve Bank of India issues currency notes on behalf of the central government. No other individual or organisation is allowed to issue currency. The rupee is widely accepted as a medium of  exchange in India. [Refer Fig. 2]                                                                                                                             Fig. 2: Modern forms of currency2. Deposits in Banks           The other form in which people hold money is as deposits with banks. People deposit their extra cash with the banks by opening a bank account in their name. Banks accept the deposits and also pay an amount as interest on the deposits. The deposits in the bank accounts can be withdrawn on demand, these deposits are called demand deposits. The payments are made by cheques instead of cash. A cheque is a paper instructing the bank to pay a specific amount from the person’s account to the person in whose name the cheque has been issued. [Refer Fig. 3]                                                                                                                                   Fig. 3: Cheque

       PHYSICSCHEMISTRYBIOLOGYMATHSLANGUAGESCIENCESOCIAL SCIENCECOMPUTER3D/AR/VREDP ISLOLabsThe OLabs is based on the idea that lab experiments can be taught using the Internet, more efficiently and less expensively. The labs can also be made available to students with no access to physical labs or where equipment is not available owing to being scarce or costly. This helps them compete with students in better equipped schools and bridges the digital divide and geographical distances. The experiments can be accessed anytime and anywhere, overcoming the constraints on time felt when having access to the physical lab for only a short period of time.The features include :Content aligned to NCERT/CBSE and State Board Syllabus.Physics, Chemistry, Biology Labs from Class 9 to Class 12. English and Maths lessons for Class 9 and 10.Interactive simulations, animations and lab videos.The concepts and understanding of the experiment.The ability to perform, record and learn experiments - anywhere, anytime, and individualised practice in all areas of experimentation.The 'learning-enabled assessment' through OLabs facilitates in the assessment of; the procedural and manipulative skills of the experiment, the concepts and understanding of the experiment and a student's reporting and interpreting skills.The development of OLabs includes the study and use of mathematical techniques to demonstrate the various complex functions in diverse areas of science. The labs make use of cutting edge simulation technology to create real world lab environments. Thorough study and research is done by research personnel for better understanding of the experimental procedures. Real lab scenarios are captured through live demonstration of the experiment so as to assimilate information on the procedures and lab equipment. Visualisation and development of the graphical symbols are done based on realistic situations and compared with the respective real equipment. Simulations are made interactive using various authoring tools, thus recreating and simulating a real lab environment.The OLabs are hosted at www.olabs.edu.in. Access to OLabs is free for Schools upon registration.   Teachers104107Schools21243 Download OLabs android app hereSchools FeedbackStudents can access the lab activities at home as well & revise ~ Avijeet Sengupta, Mahaveer Public School Jaipur. ♣ It is good for students for visual learning.Good for the schools also ~ Rakesh Khandelwal, St.Mary's Convent Sr Sec School, Ajmer. ♣ Good to have virtual experiences of real lab experiments~Babu Lal Mali, Demonstration Multipurpose School, Ajmer. ♣ Many practicals of biology which cannot be performed in labs can be shown.Student can revise the experiments any time~Atul Rathi M.P.S, Ajmer. ♣ It helps to the teacher to explain the topic with an example or practical~Sunil Kumawat, Air force School, Jodhpur. ♣ Easy to approach~Satakshi Saxena, BVB Vidyashram Pratap Nagar Jaipur. ♣ Olabs Can help to understand concepts of mathematics better~ Gurvinder Kaur, India International School. ♣ For revision of practicals as taking to lab always may not be possible ~ Gurvinder Kaur India International School. ♣ It is very helpful for teachers as well as students for fruitful practical classes~Suraj Chandra Saha Garia Academy (Model), Assam. ♣ Online labs provide every student on opportunity to understand every detail relating to their subject matter taught to them in the schools.It enables them a deeper understanding~ Sujit Malakar, Dhamma Dipa School, Tripura.Featured SimulationProperties of acid and basesA simulation to study the properties of acids using HCl solution and bases using NaOH solution by their reaction with Blue and Red Litmus solutions, Zinc metal and Solid sodium carbonate.

       PHYSICSCHEMISTRYBIOLOGYMATHSLANGUAGESCIENCESOCIAL SCIENCECOMPUTER3D/AR/VREDP ISLOLabsThe OLabs is based on the idea that lab experiments can be taught using the Internet, more efficiently and less expensively. The labs can also be made available to students with no access to physical labs or where equipment is not available owing to being scarce or costly. This helps them compete with students in better equipped schools and bridges the digital divide and geographical distances. The experiments can be accessed anytime and anywhere, overcoming the constraints on time felt when having access to the physical lab for only a short period of time.The features include :Content aligned to NCERT/CBSE and State Board Syllabus.Physics, Chemistry, Biology Labs from Class 9 to Class 12. English and Maths lessons for Class 9 and 10.Interactive simulations, animations and lab videos.The concepts and understanding of the experiment.The ability to perform, record and learn experiments - anywhere, anytime, and individualised practice in all areas of experimentation.The 'learning-enabled assessment' through OLabs facilitates in the assessment of; the procedural and manipulative skills of the experiment, the concepts and understanding of the experiment and a student's reporting and interpreting skills.The development of OLabs includes the study and use of mathematical techniques to demonstrate the various complex functions in diverse areas of science. The labs make use of cutting edge simulation technology to create real world lab environments. Thorough study and research is done by research personnel for better understanding of the experimental procedures. Real lab scenarios are captured through live demonstration of the experiment so as to assimilate information on the procedures and lab equipment.

The simulation allows the student to perform the actual experiment online.  Laws of reflection of soundAn interactive simulation that helps verify the first law (The incident wave, the normal to the reflecting surface and the reflected wave lie in one and the same plane) and the second law (The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection) of the reflection (of light), which is relevant to sound waves as well.  Right Circular Cylinder Simulation that helps to make a right circular cylinder of given height and circumference of base. A cylinder is a geometric solid that is very common in everyday life, such as a soup can. If you take the cylinder apart you find it has two ends, called bases, which are usually circular.  Pythagoras theoremthe Pythagorean theorem is a relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle.In any right-angled triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs.  Tense conversionPresent Perfect Continuous Tense : An action still continuing from the past to the present. In the Present Perfect Continuous tense, the action has been taking place for some time and is still ongoing. The duration for which the action has been going on is usually mentioned in the present perfect continuous tense.  Direct and Indirect Speech Direct Speech: In direct speech, we convey the message of the speaker in his own actual words without any change to another person. Indirect Speech: In indirect speech, we convey the message of the speaker in our own words to another person.  Schools Registered with OlabsBirla School Pilani, RajasthanKendriya Vidyalaya, Vijayanarayanam, Tamil NaduDelhi Public School, Bidhanagar Durgapur, West BengalCentral mDownload OLabs android app hereodel School, West BengalNavy Children School, Chanakyapuri, New DelhiAbhyasa International Residential School, ToopranKendriya vidyalaya Fort William, Kolkata, West BengalWoodlem Park School; AjmanK.V No-2, Jhapatapur, Railway settlement, Kharagpur, West BengalKendriya Vidyalaya Zirakpur, PunjabKendriya Vidyalaya No.2 Raipur ChhattisgarhAmrita Vidyalayam BangaloreS.G.K.C.H.S School, Susari, Dhar Madhya PradeshUniversity of the Philippines-Cebu (Lahug, Cebu City, Philippines)Nath Valley School, Aurangabad, MaharashtraKendriya Vidyalaya Cachar, AssamBudding Buds School, Tinsukia, AssamNamchi Sr. Sec School, South Sikkim, SikkimKendriya Vidyalaya No-1, AirForce Station, Jodhpur, RajasthanJawahar Navoday Vidyalay, Hosangabad, Madhya Pradesh

       PHYSICSCHEMISTRYBIOLOGYMATHSLANGUAGESCIENCESOCIAL SCIENCECOMPUTER3D/AR/VREDP ISLOLabsThe OLabs is based on the idea that lab experiments can be taught using the Internet, more efficiently and less expensively. The labs can also be made available to students with no access to physical labs or where equipment is not available owing to being scarce or costly. This helps them compete with students in better equipped schools and bridges the digital divide and geographical distances. The experiments can be accessed anytime and anywhere, overcoming the constraints on time felt when having access to the physical lab for only a short period of time.The features include :Content aligned to NCERT/CBSE and State Board Syllabus.Physics, Chemistry, Biology Labs from Class 9 to Class 12. English and Maths lessons for Class 9 and 10.Interactive simulations, animations and lab videos.The concepts and understanding of the experiment.The ability to perform, record and learn experiments - anywhere, anytime, and individualised practice in all areas of experimentation.The 'learning-enabled assessment' through OLabs facilitates in the assessment of; the procedural and manipulative skills of the experiment, the concepts and understanding of the experiment and a student's reporting and interpreting skills.The development of OLabs includes the study and use of mathematical techniques to demonstrate the various complex functions in diverse areas of science. The labs make use of cutting edge simulation technology to create real world lab environments. Thorough study and research is done by research personnel for better understanding of the experimental procedures. Real lab scenarios are captured through live demonstration of the experiment so as to assimilate information on the procedures and lab equipment. Visualisation and development of the graphical symbols are done based on realistic situations and compared with the respective real equipment. Simulations are made interactive using various authoring tools, thus recreating and simulating a real lab environment.The OLabs are hosted at www.olabs.edu.in.

       PHYSICSCHEMISTRYBIOLOGYMATHSLANGUAGESCIENCESOCIAL SCIENCECOMPUTER3D/AR/VREDP ISLOLabsThe OLabs is based on the idea that lab experiments can be taught using the Internet, more efficiently and less expensively. The labs can also be made available to students with no access to physical labs or where equipment is not available owing to being scarce or costly. This helps them compete with students in better equipped schools and bridges the digital divide and geographical distances. The experiments can be accessed anytime and anywhere, overcoming the constraints on time felt when having access to the physical lab for only a short period of time.The features include :Content aligned to NCERT/CBSE and State Board Syllabus.Physics, Chemistry, Biology Labs from Class 9 to Class 12. English and Maths lessons for Class 9 and 10.Interactive simulations, animations and lab videos.The concepts and understanding of the experiment.The ability to perform, record and learn experiments - anywhere, anytime, and individualised practice in all areas of experimentation.The 'learning-enabled assessment' through OLabs facilitates in the assessment of; the procedural and manipulative skills of the experiment, the concepts and understanding of the experiment and a student's reporting and interpreting skills.The development of OLabs includes the study and use of mathematical techniques to demonstrate the various complex functions in diverse areas of science. The labs make use of cutting edge simulation technology to create real world lab environments. Thorough study and research is done by research personnel for better understanding of the experimental procedures. Real lab scenarios are captured through live demonstration of the experiment so as to assimilate information on the procedures and lab equipment. Visualisation and development of the graphical symbols are done based on realistic situations and compared with the respective real equipment. Simulations are made interactive using various authoring tools, thus recreating and simulating a real lab environment.The OLabs are hosted at www.olabs.edu.in.

The simulation and animations allow the student to perform the actual experiment online through the computer.  Equivalent resistanceA simulation to determine the equivalent resistance of two resistors when connected in parallel. A student gets to study what resistance is, how it is measured and about resistance in a parallel combination. The simulation allows the student to perform the actual experiment online.  Laws of reflection of soundAn interactive simulation that helps verify the first law (The incident wave, the normal to the reflecting surface and the reflected wave lie in one and the same plane) and the second law (The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection) of the reflection (of light), which is relevant to sound waves as well.  Right Circular Cylinder Simulation that helps to make a right circular cylinder of given height and circumference of base. A cylinder is a geometric solid that is very common in everyday life, such as a soup can. If you take the cylinder apart you find it has two ends, called bases, which are usually circular.  Pythagoras theoremthe Pythagorean theorem is a relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle.In any right-angled triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs.  Tense conversionPresent Perfect Continuous Tense : An action still continuing from the past to the present.

       PHYSICSCHEMISTRYBIOLOGYMATHSLANGUAGESCIENCESOCIAL SCIENCECOMPUTER3D/AR/VREDP ISLOLabsThe OLabs is based on the idea that lab experiments can be taught using the Internet, more efficiently and less expensively. The labs can also be made available to students with no access to physical labs or where equipment is not available owing to being scarce or costly. This helps them compete with students in better equipped schools and bridges the digital divide and geographical distances. The experiments can be accessed anytime and anywhere, overcoming the constraints on time felt when having access to the physical lab for only a short period of time.The features include :Content aligned to NCERT/CBSE and State Board Syllabus.Physics, Chemistry, Biology Labs from Class 9 to Class 12. English and Maths lessons for Class 9 and 10.Interactive simulations, animations and lab videos.The concepts and understanding of the experiment.The ability to perform, record and learn experiments - anywhere, anytime, and individualised practice in all areas of experimentation.The 'learning-enabled assessment' through OLabs facilitates in the assessment of; the procedural and manipulative skills of the experiment, the concepts and understanding of the experiment and a student's reporting and interpreting skills.The development of OLabs includes the study and use of mathematical techniques to demonstrate the various complex functions in diverse areas of science. The labs make use of cutting edge simulation technology to create real world lab environments. Thorough study and research is done by research personnel for better understanding of the experimental procedures. Real lab scenarios are captured through live demonstration of the experiment so as to assimilate information on the procedures and lab equipment. Visualisation and development of the graphical symbols are done based on realistic situations and compared with the respective real equipment. Simulations are made interactive using various authoring tools, thus recreating and simulating a real lab environment.The OLabs are hosted at www.olabs.edu.in. Access to OLabs is free for Schools upon registration.   Teachers104107Schools21243 Download OLabs android app hereSchools FeedbackStudents can access the lab activities at home as well & revise ~ Avijeet Sengupta, Mahaveer Public School Jaipur. ♣ It is good for students for visual learning.Good for the schools also ~ Rakesh Khandelwal, St.Mary's Convent Sr Sec School, Ajmer. ♣ Good to have virtual experiences of real lab experiments~Babu Lal Mali, Demonstration Multipurpose School, Ajmer. ♣ Many practicals of biology which cannot be performed in labs can be shown.Student can revise the experiments any time~Atul Rathi M.P.S, Ajmer. ♣ It helps to the teacher to explain the topic with an example or practical~Sunil Kumawat, Air force School, Jodhpur. ♣ Easy to approach~Satakshi Saxena, BVB Vidyashram Pratap Nagar Jaipur. ♣ Olabs Can help to understand concepts of mathematics better~ Gurvinder Kaur, India International School. ♣ For revision of practicals as taking to lab always may not be possible ~ Gurvinder Kaur India International School. ♣ It is very helpful for teachers as well as students for fruitful practical classes~Suraj Chandra Saha Garia Academy (Model), Assam. ♣ Online labs provide every student on opportunity to understand every detail relating to their subject matter taught to them in the schools.It enables them a deeper understanding~ Sujit Malakar, Dhamma Dipa School, Tripura.Featured SimulationProperties of acid and basesA simulation to study the properties of acids using HCl solution and bases using NaOH solution by their reaction with Blue and Red Litmus solutions, Zinc metal and Solid sodium carbonate. The simulation and animations allow the student to perform the actual experiment online through the computer.  Equivalent resistanceA simulation to determine the equivalent resistance of two resistors when connected in parallel. A student gets to study what resistance is, how it is measured and about resistance in a parallel combination. The simulation allows the student to perform the actual experiment online.  Laws of reflection of soundAn interactive simulation that helps verify the first law (The incident wave, the normal to the reflecting surface and the reflected wave lie in one and the same plane) and the second law (The angle of incidence is equal to the angle of reflection) of the reflection (of light), which is relevant to sound waves as well.  Right Circular Cylinder Simulation that helps to make a right circular cylinder of given height and circumference of base. A cylinder is a geometric solid that is very common in everyday life, such as a soup can. If you take the cylinder apart you find it has two ends, called bases, which are usually circular.  Pythagoras theoremthe Pythagorean theorem is a relation in Euclidean geometry among the three sides of a right triangle.In any right-angled triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs.  Tense conversionPresent Perfect Continuous Tense : An action still continuing from the past to the present. In the Present Perfect Continuous tense, the action has been taking place for some time and is still ongoing. The duration for which the action has been going on is usually mentioned in the present perfect continuous tense.  Direct and Indirect Speech Direct Speech: In direct speech, we convey the message of the speaker in his own actual words without any change to another person. Indirect Speech: In indirect speech, we convey the message of the speaker in our own words to another person.  Schools Registered with OlabsBirla School Pilani, RajasthanKendriya Vidyalaya, Vijayanarayanam, Tamil NaduDelhi Public School, Bidhanagar Durgapur, West BengalCentral mDownload OLabs android app hereodel School, West BengalNavy Children School, Chanakyapuri, New DelhiAbhyasa International Residential School, ToopranKendriya vidyalaya Fort William, Kolkata, West BengalWoodlem Park School; AjmanK.V No-2, Jhapatapur, Railway settlement, Kharagpur, West BengalKendriya Vidyalaya Zirakpur, PunjabKendriya Vidyalaya No.2 Raipur ChhattisgarhAmrita Vidyalayam BangaloreS.G.K.C.H.S School, Susari, Dhar Madhya PradeshUniversity of the Philippines-Cebu (Lahug, Cebu City, Philippines)Nath Valley School, Aurangabad, MaharashtraKendriya Vidyalaya Cachar, AssamBudding Buds School, Tinsukia, AssamNamchi Sr. Sec School, South Sikkim, SikkimKendriya Vidyalaya No-1, AirForce Station, Jodhpur, RajasthanJawahar Navoday Vidyalay, Hosangabad, Madhya Pradesh
