⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ObjectiveTo implement a program to swap two numbers.  TheorySwapping two numbers has various practical applications in real life, particularly in sorting, game development, algorithm design, data organization, and memory management. Here swapping is done using function constructs in Python.A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. It allows you to organize code into modular, reusable pieces. A function in Python is defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses containing any parameters. The function body contains the code to be executed when the function is called. A function can return a value to the caller using the return statement. If no return statement is specified, the function returns None by default.In Python, understanding how arguments are passed to functions is essential. Two ways to pass arguments are pass by value and pass by reference.Pass by Value: The function gets a copy of the argument's value. Changes to the parameter inside the function do not affect the original argument.Pass by Reference: The function gets a reference to the actual argument. Changes to the parameter inside the function affect the original argument.One advantage of passing by value is that it is simpler and safer, as the function cannot modify the original data. But not suitable for handling huge and complex data. InstructionsThe program to swap two numbers and its equivalent low-level language instructions executed by the hardware are given below.  assignIt assigns a value to a variable.loadIt loads a value of a global or local variable to the given register.storeIt stores the value from the given register to the global or local variable.outIt prints the output value to the screen.copyIt copies the value of a variable between segments of memory.pushIt pushes a variable onto the stack.popIt pops out the variable out of the stack.fcallIt initiates a call to the given function.fenterIt changes the control of execution to the called function.freturnIt returns the control from the called function to the caller.exitSignifies the end of the program  Learning OutcomesLearners will understand the concept of functions in Python and how to use them to swap two numbers.  Learners will understand the advantages and disadvantages of using call-by-value function-calling mechanism. Learners will learn how to return values from a function effectively.

⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠Procedure Real Lab Procedure Store the numbers to be swapped in variables a and b, with values 30 and 40, respectively.Define a swap() function that accepts these values and swaps them using a temporary variable temp.Call the swap() function using the call by value method.Inside the swap() function, the numbers are successfully swapped.Print the values of a and b outside of the swap() function.Observe that the values of a and b remain unchanged, demonstrating the limitation of call by value in Python, where the original variables are not affected by changes inside the function.Simulator ProcedureClick the start button. Keep pressing the forward arrow (green) in the code segment. One press causes one low-level language instruction to be executed.Finally, click the close button to terminate the execution.

1)What will be the value of a and b after executing the code? a, b = 20, 30  b, a = a, b   a = 20, b = 30 Raises a TypeError a = 30, b = 20 a = 50, b = 50 2)Which of the following statements will swap the values of a and b initialized as a, b = 20, 30 in Python?   A) a = b and b = a B) temp = a; a = b; b = temp
 D) Both B and C   C) a, b = b, a 3)What happens if there are fewer variables than values in the assignment, such as:  a, b = 20, 30, 40   Assigns (20, 30, 40) to a. Assigns 40 to both a and b. Only 20 and 30 will be assigned to a and b. Raises a ValueError. 4)If a and b are assigned as a, b = 12, 15, which statement demonstrates a swapping method using arithmetic operations?   a, b = a * b, a / b a, b = b, a temp = a; b = temp; a = b a = a + b; b = a - b; a = a – b 5)What will happen if you try the following code?  a, b = 2.5, 'hello'  a, b = b, a  print(a, b)   Prints 2.5 hello TypeError ValueError Prints hello 2.5 6)Consider the following Python code:  def modify(x):    x = 20  a = 10  modify(a)  print(a)  What is the output?   None 20 10   Error 7)What low-level language instruction is executed at the end of a function to return control to the caller?   RET    CALL POP JMP 8)Which of the following instructions is typically used in low-level language programming to perform a function call?   RET PUSH JMP CALL   9)In Python, when a function is called, the arguments are passed by call by value. What happens when you modify a parameter inside the function?   The argument passed to the function is modified inside the function, but the changes are not reflected outside. A new variable is created inside the function, and the original argument remains unchanged. The argument passed to the function cannot be modified. The argument passed to the function is modified outside the function as well. 10)What will be the output of the following Python code?  def test():     a = 10     if a > 5:       print("Greater than 5")     print("End of function")  test()   End of function Greater than 5 SyntaxError Greater than 5

⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ObjectiveTo implement a program that computes the LCM of any given two numbers.   Theory The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two integers is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both numbers. For example, the LCM of 4 and 5 is 20 because 20 is the smallest number that is divisible by both 4 and 5. There’s a relationship between the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and the LCM of two numbers, which is given by the formula: LCM(a, b) = |a, b| / GCD(a, b) Where: a and b are the two numbers. |a.b| is the absolute product of a and b. GCD(a,b) is the greatest common divisor of a and b.  InstructionsThe program to compute the LCM and its equivalent low-level language instructions is executed by the hardware. The low-level language instructions used are:  rem  It performs a division operation of the values contained in two registers and puts the remainder in the first register.   rcopy  Passing variable value back to caller function.   push  It pushes a variable on to the stack.   pop  It pops out the variable out of the stack.  store  It stores the value from the given register to the global or local variable.   out  It prints the output value to the screen.   neq  Check if the values in two registers are different.   mul  It multiplies the values contained in two registers and puts the result in the first register.   lcopy  Local copying - used to copy the value of a variable within the same memory segment.   load  It loads a value of a global or local variable to the given register.   label  Is used to mark the position in the low-level language instructions to enable jumping to the marked position.   in  It reads the input from the user and stores it in a variable.   if_true  Checks if the condition is evaluated to true.   if_false  Checks if the condition is evaluated to be false.   freturn  It returns the control from the called function to the caller.   fenter  It changes the control of execution to the called function.   fcall  It initiates a call to the given function.   exit  Signifies the end of the program.   div  It divides the values contained in two registers and puts the result in the first register.   copy  It copies the value of a variable between segments of memory.   assign  It assigns a value to a variable.    Learning OutcomesStudents will be able to write code in Python to find the LCM of any two numbers. Students will understand and apply the concept of GCD, the largest positive integer that divides both input numbers without a remainder, to find the LCM in a Python program. Students will be able to understand and implement low-level instructions for finding the LCM of two numbers. Learners will gain experience in defining and using functions to modularize code, promoting code reusability and readability.  Students will be able to understand the use of the stack segment in computer memory.

ObjectiveTo implement a program that computes the factorial of a number in a recursive manner.   TheoryInstructionsA recursive function is a function that calls itself in order to solve a problem. Recursive functions typically break a problem down into smaller subproblems, solve each of those subproblems, and then combine the results to form a solution to the original problem.Base Case: This is a condition under which the function stops calling itself. It is essential to prevent infinite recursion, which can lead to a stack overflow error. Recursive Case: This is the part of the function that includes the call to itself. It typically involves a smaller or simpler version of the original problem. Example: calculating the factorial of a number n (denoted as n!). Factorial Definition: n! = n×(n−1)!   for n>0 0! = 1  (base case) Recursive solutions can sometimes be less efficient than iterative ones due to the overhead of multiple function calls. However, they can lead to simpler and more readable code, especially for problems naturally defined recursively. The program to compute the factorial of a number in a recursive manner and its equivalent low-level language instructions executed by the hardware are given below: remIt performs a division operation on the values contained in two registers and puts the remainder in the first register.  rcopyPassing variable value back to the caller function.  pushIt pushes a variable onto the stack.  popIt pops the variable out of the stack.  storeIt stores the value from the given register to the global or local variable.  outIt prints the output value to the screen.   neqCheck if the values in two registers are different.  mulIt multiplies the values contained in two registers and puts the result in the first register. lcopyLocal copying is used to copy the value of a variable within the same memory segment.loadIt loads the value of a global or local variable into the given register.  labelIs used to mark the position in the low-level language instructions to enable jumping to the marked position.  inIt reads the input from the user and stores it in a variable.  if_trueChecks if the condition is evaluated as true. if_falseChecks if the condition is evaluated as false. freturnIt returns the control from the called function to the caller.  fenterIt changes the control of execution to the called function. fcallIt initiates a call to the given function.exitSignifies the end of the program.divIt divides the values contained in two registers and puts the result in the first register. copyIt copies the value of a variable between segments of memory.  assignIt assigns a value to a variable.  Learning OutcomesLearners will able to explain how the factorial of a number is calculated using recursive calls, where breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems. Learners will be able to understand the concept of recursion and how functions can call themselves. Learners will be able to recognise the base case in a recursive function, which serves as the termination condition to stop the recursive calls. Learners will be able to trace the execution of the recursive calls for a given input. Learners will be able to define and call a function in python.

ObjectiveTo implement a program to read a number from the user.  TheoryThe "Read a Number" Python program serves as a fundamental example that provides insights into how Python can interact with users in real-world scenarios. It highlights the usage of basic functions, such as input() for receiving user input and int() for converting input to integers. This program offers a starting point for beginners to comprehend the essentials of user interaction and function usage in Python programming.   InstructionsThe program reads a number from the user and its equivalent low-level language instructions executed by the hardware. The low-level language instructions used are: Declare a variable n1 to hold the user input.  Get the number from the user using the input function.  The default data type of the user input is a string. So 'int()' is used to convert the string-type data into integer-type data.  Finally, print the user input on the console or screen.   inIt reads the input from the user and stores it in a variable.  outIt prints the output value to the screen.     Learning Outcomes Students will learn how to use the 'input()' function in Python to prompt the user for input and store the entered value in a variable. Students will understand the need for the 'int()' function and learn how it converts the user input (which is initially a string) into an integer data type. Students will explore how the 'print()' statement is used to display the entered number on the console, demonstrating the fundamental concept of output in Python.

ObjectiveTo implement a program that finds the largest among any given three numbers.   InstructionsThe program to find the largest number of any given three numbers and their equivalent low-level language instructions executed by the hardware are given below: if_false  Checks if the condition evaluated to be false.  if_trueChecks if the condition evaluated to true.inIt reads the input from the user and stores it in a variable.labelIs used to mark the position in the low-level language instructions to enable jumping to the marked position.  loadIt loads a value of a global or local variable to the given register. gtThe greater than operator checks whether the first operand is greater than the second operand and returns a boolean value based on the condition.outIt prints the output value to the screen. exitExit from the execution.   Pseudo CodePrompt the user to enter three numbers (num1, num2, num3)   If num1 is greater than or equal to num2 and num1 is greater than or equal to num3:              Print "num1 is the largest"   Else if num2 is greater than or equal to num1 and num2 is greater than or equal to num3:           Print "num2 is the largest"   Else:         Print "num3 is the largest" End The pseudocode compares three input numbers to determine the largest. It checks whether the first number is larger than or equal to the others, then does the same for the second. If neither is the largest, the third number is considered the largest. The result is printed accordingly.  Learning OutcomesThe provided Python program for finding the largest among three integer numbers is a simple example that covers several fundamental concepts in programming.Learners will learn to use the input() function to receive input, which returns data in the form of a string. Learners will understand the use of int (). Learners will understand the use of conditional statements (if, elif and else) for decision-making. Learners will understand how to compare numbers, which is basic for implementing sorting operation. Learners became familiar with the application of logical operator ‘and’ to combine multiple condition statements.

ProcedureReal Lab ProcedureStep 1:  The user is prompted to enter three numbers (num1, num2, num3). Step 2: checks if num1 is greater than or equal to both num2 and num3. If true, it prints that num1 is the largest. Step 3: If the first condition is false, the second condition checks if num2 is greater than or equal to both num1 and num3. If true, it prints that num2 is the largest. Step 4: If neither of the previous conditions is true, then num3 is the largest by default. Simulator ProcedureSelect the simulator tab. Click the “OK” button on the CLICK TO START dialog box. Then press the “START” button under the Code Segment. To execute the program line by line, click the forward arrow. Input three numbers. Keep pressing the forward arrow until the program terminates. Finally, the program terminates by displaying the largest number.

ObjectiveTo implement a program that checks whether a given three-digit number qualifies as an Armstrong number or not.  TheoryAn Armstrong number is a special kind of number in math. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.  For example, let's take two 3-digit numbers, 153 and 125:                           13 + 53 + 33 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153                           13 + 23 + 53    = 1 + 8 + 125 = 134 So, 153 is an Armstrong number. Whereas 125 is not an Armstrong number.  Let's say we have an n-digit number abcd... (where each letter represents a digit).  Then    an +bn +cn + dn.+…= The number itself, is an Armstrong number.  InstructionsThe program to check whether the given number is Armstrong or not and its low-level language instructions used are as follows: addIt adds the values contained in the register and stores the result in the first register.  assignIt assigns a value to a variable.divIt divides the values contained in two registers and puts the result in the first register. eqIt is the equal to operator; check if the values in two registers are the same. gtThe greater than operator checks whether the first operand is greater than the second operand and returns a boolean value based on the condition. if _false Checks if the condition is evaluated to be false. if_trueChecks if the condition is evaluated as true.inIt reads the input from the user and stores it in a variable. labelIs used to mark the position in the low-level language instructions to enable jumping to the marked position. loadIt loads a value of a global or local variable to the given register. mulIt multiplies the values contained in two registers and puts the result in the first register. outIt prints the output value to the screen. remIt performs a division operation of the values contained in two registers and puts the remainder in the first register. storeIt stores the value from the given register to the global or local variable. subIt subtracts the value contained in the second register from the first register.   Learning OutcomesBelow are the few learning objectives associated with this program. Understand how to receive user input in Python using the input() function and learn how to store input in variables and manipulate them within the program.  To understand the significance of using temporary variables in certain algorithms.  Comprehend the use of a while loop for iterative processing and understand the loop condition and how it controls the execution of the block of code.  Learn how to perform basic arithmetic operations (%, //) in Python and understand how these operations are used in extracting digits and updating the temporary variable.  Understand the algorithm for checking if a given number is an Armstrong number.

ObjectiveTo implement a program that calculates simple interest.  TheorySimple interest is a method of calculating interest on a principal amount over a specified period of time. It is called "simple" because it is calculated only on the original principal, without considering any interest that may have been previously earned. Simple interest finds relevance in various aspects of our daily lives, such as calculating interest for bank deposits or loans obtained from financial institutions.  The formula for simple interest is given below.  Simple interest formula is given as:  SI=(PTR) / 100 Where SI = simple interest P = principal amount R = interest rate (in percentage) T = time duration (in years)  InstructionsThe program computes the simple interest, and its equivalent low-level language instructions are executed by the hardware. The low-level language instructions used are:assign It assigns a value to a variable.   div It divides the values contained in two registers and puts the result in the first register.   in It reads the input from the user and stores it in a variable. load It loads a value of a global or local variable to the given register.   mul It multiplies the values contained in two registers and puts the result in the first register.   out It prints the output value to the screen.   store It stores the value from the given register to the global or local variable.   exit Signifies the end of the program.    Learning Outcomes Students will be able to understand the fundamental concepts, such as variables and input/output functions, available in Python. Students will be able to demonstrate the use of variables to store user input and showcase the assignment of values to variables and their subsequent use in calculations.  Students will understand the concept of precedence and associativity in Python expressions.  Students will be able to employ Python for the calculation of simple interest.  Students will understand the different low-level instructions corresponding to high-level instructions.

ObjectiveTo implement a program that calculates compound interest.  TheoryCompound interest is the interest calculated on the principal and the interest accumulated over the previous period. It is the most used concept in our daily existence. Compound interest finds its usage in most of the transactions in the banking and finance sectors and other areas. Some of its applications are:  Calculation of equated monthly installment (EMI).The growth of bacteria. Increase or decrease in the value of an item. Equation for finding total amount using compound interest is as follows:                    Total Amount = P(1+r/100)tp P = Principal value tp = Time period for which Principal value is invested in yearsr = Rate of interest per annumInstructionsThe program to compute the compound interest and its equivalent low-level language instructions executed by the hardware are given below:  addIt adds the values contained in the register and stores the result in the first register.   assignIt assigns a value to a variable. divIt divides the values contained in two registers and puts the result in the first register. if_false    Checks if the condition is evaluated to be false. if_trueChecks if the condition is evaluated as true. inIt reads the input from the user and stores it in a variable. incrIt increases the value contained in the register by 1. labelIs used to mark the position in the Low-level Language Instructions to enable jumping to the marked position. loadIt loads a value of a global or local variable to the given register. lteLesser than or equal to operator, check whether the first operand is lesser than second   operand and return a Boolean value based on the condition.mulIt multiplies the values contained in two registers and puts the result in the first register. outIt prints the output value to the screen. storeIt stores the value from the given register to the global or local variable. exitSignifies the end of the program. Variables used in the Python programn - Initial investment or principal amount. r - Annual interest rate (as an integer, not a percentage). y - Number of years. Learning OutcomesThis program serves as a learning tool for students, particularly those learning about basic financial concepts and programming.  Students will learn to use the input() function to get user input.  Students will grasp the concept of a ‘for’ loop and its syntax.  Students will be able to recognize the order of operations in mathematical expressions.  Students will learn how to modify a variable within a loop to perform iterative calculations. Students will gain exposure to the concept of compound interest and how it affects the growth of an investment over time.

⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ObjectiveTo implement a Python program that checks whether the given number is a prime number or not. TheoryA prime number is a positive integer greater than 1, it has no positive integer divisors other than 1 and itself. In other words, a prime number can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. These numbers are important in many areas of mathematics, including number theory, cryptography, and computer science. Here are some examples of the first few prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29.   Number 6 is not a prime number because it can be evenly divided by either 2 or 3. InstructionsThe program finds whether the given number is a prime and its equivalent low-level language instructions executed by the hardware. The low-level language instructions used are:  assignIt assigns a value to a variable. divIt divides the values contained in two registers and puts the result in the first register. eqIt checks if the values contained in two registers are same. if_falseChecks if the condition evaluated to be false. if_trueChecks if the condition evaluated to true. inIt reads the input from the user and stores it in a variable. incrIt increases the value contained in the register by 1. labelIs used to mark the position in the low-level instructions to enable jumping to the marked position. loadIt loads a value of a global or local variable to the given register. lte Lesser than or equal to operator, check whether the first operand is lesser than the second operand and return a boolean value based on the condition. outIt prints the output value to the screen. remIt performs a division operation of the values contained in two registers and puts the remainder in the first register. storeIt stores the value from the given register to the global or local variable. Learning OutcomesStudents gain insight into the basic mathematical logic of prime numbers and how it is implemented in the program.  Students will understand the logic for checking whether a number is prime or not by iterating through potential divisors.  Students will understand the use of the ‘break’ statement to exit from the loop.  Students will learn about various conditional (>=, <= and ==) and arithmetic (+, %) operators available in Python. Students will be able to understand and apply nested if-else statements effectively.

⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠table { margin-left:30px; }ObjectiveTo implement a program that computes xⁿ, where x and n are given integers. InstructionsThe program prints the exponentiation between two integer numbers, and its equivalent low-level language instructions executed by the hardware are given below.addIt adds the values contained in the register and stores the result in the first register.   assignIt assigns a value to a variable. neqnot equal operator returns True if two variables are of the same type and have different values, if the values are the same then it returns False.if_false    Checks if the condition is evaluated to be false. if_trueChecks if the condition is evaluated to be true. inIt reads the input from the user and stores it in a variable. incrIt increases the value contained in the register by 1. labelIt is used to mark the position in the low-level language instructions to enable jumping to the marked position. loadIt loads a value of a global or local variable to the given register. lteLesser than or equal to the operator, check whether the first operand is lesser than the second operand and return a Boolean value based on the condition. mulIt multiplies the values contained in two registers and puts the result in the first register. outIt prints the output value to the screen. storeIt stores the value from the given register to the global or local variable. exitSignifies the end of the program.  TheoryThe xn represents x raised to the power n, which means multiplying x by itself n times and xn is called "x raised to the power of n" or simply "x to the power n". In mathematical terms, it represents the operation of exponentiation, where x is the base (the number being multiplied) and n is the exponent (Indicates how many times the base is multiplied.).For example: 50 = 1 (any number raised to the power 0 is 1) 23  = 8 (base is 2 and exponent term is 3) Few Uses of the Power Operation (xn):Mathematics:Calculating growth, such as compound interest or exponential growth.Representing repeated multiplication in algebra and calculus.Physics:Modeling natural phenomena like radioactive decay and population growth.Describing energy relationships, such as E=mc2.Engineering:Power functions are used in signal processing, control systems, and robotics.Calculating electrical power: P = I2R, where current I is squared.Computer Science:Algorithms, especially those that deal with cryptography.Machine learning (polynomial regression uses powers of variables).Daily Life:Calculations for finance, such as loan repayments and investment returns.Estimating exponential growth or decay (e.g., population studies). Learning Outcomes Students will be able to perform the exponential operation between any two-integer number. Students will understand the low-level language instructions involved in the calculation of x raised to the power of n.Students will be able to understand the use of the not equal to (!=) comparison operator. Students will become more familiar with ‘while’ looping constructs. Students will understand the importance of indentation (white space) in Python.

Objective
To study vegetative propagation in potato, Bryophyllum, and an aquatic plant. 
 
Theory
Vegetative Propagation
Plants can reproduce vegetatively by using their stems, roots, and leaves. It is an asexual reproductive method used by plants. Through vegetative plant structures, vegetative propagation takes place. The vegetative propagation structures in non-vascular plants are gemmae and spores, whereas they are the roots, stems, leaves, and nodes in vascular plants. 
Types: 
Vegetative propagation by roots.
Vegetative propagation by stem. 
Vegetative propagation by leaf bud. 
 
Vegetative Propagation in Potato
Vegetative methods are mostly used to propagate potatoes (cloning). There are nodes or eyes in potato tubers for new growth of sprouts. Sprouts are the new stems that are emerging from each eye and they give life to a new plant. A sliced tuber or a complete tuber can be used as vegetative seed. 
Vegetative Propagation in Bryophyllum
In Bryophyllum, vegetative propagation occurs through leaf growth. Bryophyllum leaves have notches along their borders and are broad. The notches give rise to buds. These buds can develop into new plants with roots, shoots, and tiny leaves. When the young plants meet the soil, they separate from the leaves and grow into mature plants. 
Vegetative Propagation in Eichhornia
The aquatic weed Eichhornia crassipes, often known as water hyacinth, is popularly referred to as the terror of Bengal because it spreads quickly, stunts the growth of other species, and even completely eradicates them. To grow, water hyacinth uses offsets. A short, thick runner, like a branch, that bears a new plant at the end is called an offset. Offsets develop from the parent plant's main stem in all directions. 
Learning Outcomes
Students can understand the different types of vegetative propagation. 
Students can understand the vegetative structures of the plants.
Students can understand the habitat and growth of the new plant compared to the old one.

ObjectiveTo study the presence of micro-organism in pond water. TheoryMicro-organismMicroorganisms, which are single-celled creatures, belong to four kingdoms: the plant, bacterial, fungal, and protozoan kingdoms. Even though they all appear to be the same, microorganisms are the most diverse group of organisms in the world because one of their few commonalities is their tiny size. Ecological processes and food webs, as well as life itself, would not be possible without these microorganisms. Microorganisms help to produce oxygen, aid in decomposition, release nutrients, and promote the carbon cycle.  Four Divisions Bacteria Fungi Protozoa AlgaeBacteriaThey are exceptional at aiding in ecosystem breakdown and nitrogen cycling due to their extraordinary capacity for rapid multiplication. There are heterotrophic bacteria and autotrophic bacteria, specifically. The former is in charge of decomposition and the cycling of nutrients, while the latter are typically called as cyanobacteria.                                                     Fig. 1 Bacteria FungiIt can be strange to think of fungi as microbes because they are frequently huge and simple to observe. However, fungi can also live in the form of tiny filaments known as hyphae and are single-celled organisms that initially grow quite small. Due to their heterotrophic nature, fungi release enzymes into the environment that transform substances and nutrients into forms that are usable by other organisms.                                                            Fig. 2 Fungi ProtozoaProtozoa are microscopic, single-celled organisms that resemble animals in that they depend on the consumption of other species to provide them with the nutrients they require to survive. For example, bacteria help in the degradation of organic matter, and both the bacteria and the detritus are consumed by protozoans. Ponds commonly contain the species Euglena, Paramecium, amoebas, and ciliates. Protozoans are beneficial.                                                        Fig. 3 Protozoa AlgaeAlgae are the most well-known organisms found in ponds. They may aggregate to form massive colonies, or they may be microscopic. Because they are the base of the food web, algae play a crucial role in pond ecosystems. Insects eat them, and insects are eaten by fish, birds, herps, and other mammals. A few creatures will even consume algae directly.                                                            Fig. 4 Algae Learning OutcomesStudents understand  The concept of micro-organisms. The four major divisions of micro-organisms. The structure and uses of micro-organisms.

Our Objective
Show that air exerts pressure. 
 
The Theory
Air is made up of molecules of different gases. The particles in air are continuously moving in all direction and collides with each other as well as with the walls of the container. The force exerted by air particles pushing in all directions is known as air pressure. As the particles in air increases, more particles will collide with the walls resulting in increased pressure. 
Atmospheric pressure 
The pressure exerted by air molecules on the Earth’s surface is called as atmospheric pressure. As the atmospheric pressure is due to weight of the air particles above, it is high at the sea level. When you ascend a mountain, the amount of air molecules per unit area decreases. As a result, atmospheric pressure is low compared to sea level.  As the air pressure decreases, the amount of oxygen available also decreases. Hence, mountaineers carry oxygen cylinders when climbing very high peaks.  
An instrument used to measure atmospheric pressure is called a barometer. 
High pressure to Low pressure 
It should be noted that the air always flows from a place with high pressure to a place with low pressure. This flow of air caused by variation in air pressure is called as wind. The speed of the wind mainly depends on the difference in air pressure between the two regions. Strong winds can be so destructive that they can blow away roofs, uproot trees, sink boats or torn down power lines. 
What makes the bird fly? 
It is the air pressure that makes the birds fly. Birds and aeroplanes have a unique wing shape that allows air to flow more quickly over the top of the wing. The pressure of the air lowers as it moves faster. As a result, the pressure on the top of the wing is lower than that on the bottom. The difference in pressure creates a force on the wing pushing them up. The force that helps the bird to rise upward is referred to as lift.  
     
Learning Outcomes
Students can understand the concept of pressure. 
Students can learn that air can exert pressure. 
Students can get an idea on the concept of atmospheric pressure. 
Students can understand that the air always flows from a place with high pressure to a place with low pressure. 
Students can learn that a large difference in pressure can cause deformation of objects.

Activity 1
Materials Required
Plastic bottle  
Hot water 
Cold water 
Glass tumbler
 
The Procedure
Real Lab Procedure
Take a soft plastic bottle. 
Fill it half with hot water. 
Empty it and immediately cap the bottle tightly. 
Now pour ice cold water over this bottle. 
Observe the change.
Simulator Procedure
Fill empty plastic bottle with Hot water. 
Empty the water and immediately cap the bottle. 
Place the bottle in the glass tub.
Pour cold water from another glass tumbler. 
Observe the change in the bottle.
 
Observation
The plastic bottle gets deformed when cold water is poured over it.  
 
Conclusion
The air inside the bottle becomes hot when we fill the bottle with hot water and empty it. On pouring cold water over it, this hot air becomes cold and pressure inside the bottle decreases. The bottle is crushed as the outside air pressure is higher. 
If the bottle was not capped immediately after the hot water is emptied, outside air would have entered the bottle until the pressure inside and outside the bottle becomes equal or uniform, hence there will not be any deformation. 
Thus, we can conclude that the air exerts pressure. 
 
Activity 2
Materials Required
Conical Flask
Bunsen Burner
Stand
Thermometer
Tripod Stand
Glass Tumbler
 
The Procedure
Real Lab Procedure
Take a conical flask and fill it half with water. 
Boil water.
Once the water starts boiling, remove the conical flask from the heat. 
Once the boiling stops, pour some cold water on the conical flask. What do you observe? 
Simulator Procedure
Pour water from the glass tumbler to the conical flask.
Place it on the bunsen burner and boil it.
After it starts boiling, place the flask on the stand.
When the boiling stops, pour cold water on the conical flask.
 
Observation
Boiling of water starts when we pour the cold water over the flask after the removal of conical flask from heat.
 
Conclusion
When we pour cool water on the flask, lower pressure induces. As the pressure decreases, the boiling point of water decreases. Water boils even at low temperatures due to the decrease in boiling point of water as the pressure decreases.

Objective
To show that oxygen is necessary for the combustion of a substance. 
 
Theory 
Combustion is the name given to the chemical reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen to produce heat. The substances which undergo combustion are called combustible substances or fuel. Fuel can be solid, liquid, or gaseous. 
There are various types of combustions such as rapid combustion, spontaneous combustion, explosion, etc. In rapid combustion, the gas burns rapidly and generates heat and light. The spontaneous combustion is a type of combustion where a substance spontaneously catches fire without any externally applied trigger. On the other hand, an explosion is a sudden reaction that involves the generation of heat, light, and sound. Such reaction results in the release of a large amount of gas. 
Air is necessary for combustion. During the process of combustion, the fuel burns in oxygen (present in air) to produce carbon dioxide, water and energy in the form of heat and light. Combustion cannot happen without oxygen. Approximately 21% of the air in Earth's atmosphere is oxygen. This oxygen is utilized in burning. In fact, the three components that are needed to sustain a fire —oxygen, heat, and fuel—are collectively known as the fire triangle. Removing any of these three elements extinguishes the fire. 
Eliminating the fuel source for example turning off gas valve can easily stop combustion. Another method is to add water to the fire, which reduces heat because most of the heat is used to turn the water into steam. Cutting off the oxygen supply is another approach that can be used to stop fire. Most fire extinguishers work by separating the fuel from the oxygen. Since the oxygen must come into contact with the fuel, if the fuel is covered with something that keeps the oxygen away, the fire will go out. This is the rationale behind why we cover someone with a blanket to put out a fire when his or her clothing catches on fire. 
If you perform an activity that involves covering a candle with a beaker, the candle within the beaker will continue to burn until the air inside the beaker is completely depleted of oxygen. After that, the lack of oxygen causes it to stop burning. This experiment demonstrates that oxygen is essential for burning. 
Some examples of combustion are: 
Burning of wood 
Burning of a wax candle 
Combustion of petrol in a car’s engine 
Burning of natural gas or LPG in a bunsen burner or gas stove 
Fireworks 
 
Learning Outcomes  
Students can learn about combustion. 
Students can understand the requirement of combustion. 
Students can learn to analyse the necessity of a substance for a reaction by removing the condition.

Procedure
Real Lab Procedure
Take two candles and fix them on a table. 
Light both the candles and let them burn for some time. 
Now cover one of the candles with a beaker and observe it for some time. 
Simulator Procedure 
Look at the two lighted candles kept on the laboratory table. 
Take the beaker and cover one of the candles with it.
Observe the flame. 
Notice that the candle which is not covered continues burning. 
The candle which is covered, continues burning for some time and gets extinguished. 
 
Observation
It is found that the candle which is not covered continues burning. 
The candle which is covered, continues burning for some time and gets extinguished. 
 
Conclusion
The candle within the beaker keeps burning until all of the oxygen in the air inside the beaker has been consumed. After that it stops burning due to non-availability of oxygen. 
This activity shows that oxygen is necessary for combustion process.

Objective
To study how shadows are formed.
 
Theory
If you shine a torch on the wall and bring your hand in front of the light beam, you can see dark patches formed on the wall. This dark region surrounded by light is referred to as a shadow.  
Shadows are formed when an opaque object comes in the path of light. Since the light travels in a straight line, whenever you place an opaque object in the path of light, the light rays in that region is blocked. Hence, the shadows are formed in the shape of the object. In fact, you can even make accurate guess of the object from its shadow. 
Essential requirements for a shadow are: 
A source of light: 
   Since shadows are formed when the light from a source is blocked, a source of light is necessary for the formation of a shadow. The source of light can be natural (such as sun) or artificial (such as a torch light, bulb etc.). Shadows are not produced in dark rooms. 
An opaque object:  
    An opaque material does not allow light to pass through it. If you use a transparent or translucent object, the light is not effectively blocked as these materials allow the light to pass through them. 
A screen: 
The characteristics of the shadow formed depend on the position and intensity of the source of light. For instance, while walking on the road at noon when the sun is directly overhead, you can see a short and dark shadow. On the other hand, you might find that your shadows are longer in the early morning or late afternoon. Our forefathers made good use of this fact when they devised the sundial as an instrument to show time. A sundial consists of a horizontal circular plate and a projection called a gnomon. The sundial indicates the time of day by the position of the shadow of gnomon exposed to the sun's rays. As the day progresses, the sun moves across the sky, causing the shadow of the gnomon to move and indicating the passage of time.  Sundials were the only means of telling the time prior to the development of clocks. In fact, the world’s largest sundial is situated at Jantar Mantar in Jaipur, Rajasthan.

Materials Required
A torch (source of light);
A circular piece of wood
A sheet of butter paper or tracing paper
A transparent glass sheet or cellophane sheet
A white screen (any white sheet can also be used as a screen)
 
Procedure
Real Lab Procedure
Take the circular piece of wood. 
Place a screen on one side of the wooden piece or position the wooden piece in front of a wall. 
Use a torch to shed light on the wooden piece. Make sure that the surface of the wooden piece is parallel to the surface of the screen or wall. 
Observe the dark patch formed on the wall or screen. 
Move the torch closer to or farther from the wooden piece and observe the change in size of the dark patch. 
Now, switch off the torch light. 
Observe if the dark patch is still formed. 
Remove the screen and switch on the torch again. 
Observe that no dark patch is seen. 
Repeat the above steps using a sheet of tracing paper in place of the wooden piece. 
Observe that no dark patch is seen at the place of the screen.
Now repeat the steps using a transparent glass sheet and record your observations. 
Compare the observations made by you in all the three cases. 
Simulator Procedure
Move towards the table.
	
Note: The circular wooden piece blocks the light from falling on a certain area on the screen, hence forming a dark circular patch on the screen. This region is called a shadow. 
Turn off the Torch by pressing the E key. 
	
Note: Observe that the dark patch disappears, provided there is no other light in the room.
Remove the Whiteboard by pressing the Q key. 
Turn on the Torch by pressing the E key. 
	
Note: If the screen is removed, no dark patch is seen.
Bring back the Whiteboard by pressing the Q key.
Go through the different types of objects and observe their shadows. 
Observe the light falling on screen for tracing paper. 
	
Note: The tracing paper allows some light to pass through it. As a result, a hazy patch is formed while a transparent glass sheet allows most of the light to pass through it; hence no clear shadow is formed.
Observation 
The entire screen does not light up when light is shone on the wooden piece with a screen or wall behind it. The circular wooden piece is blocking the light from falling on a certain area on the screen, hence forming a dark circular patch on the screen. 
If the distance between the torch and the wooden piece is decreased, the size of the shadow increases. If the distance between the torch and the wooden piece is increased, the size of the shadow decreases.
If the torch is switched off, the dark patch vanishes, provided there is no other light in the room.  
If the screen is removed, no dark patch or shadow is seen. 
When tracing paper is used, no dark patch is obtained. A hazy patch is formed in this case.
When a transparent glass sheet is used in place of the wooden block, no clear patch can be obtained on the screen.
 
Conclusion
The dark circular patch formed on the screen is because the wooden disc is blocking light in that circular region. This region is called a shadow. 
A shadow is formed when an opaque object is placed in the path of light. 
A light source, an opaque object, and the existence of a screen are the essential requirements to obtain a shadow.  
Tracing paper is a translucent object, it allows some light to pass through it. Hence, we get a hazy patch on the screen. 
A transparent glass sheet allows most of the light to pass through it; hence, no clear shadow is formed. 
The size of the shadow depends on the distance between the source of light and the object.

1)Consider a scenario where you're in a room with various objects and a single source of light. You notice that some objects cast distinct shadows while others don't. Based on this observation, which type of object is most likely to create a shadow? 
   Transparent objects that allow light to pass through completely 
 Opaque objects that block light entirely  Translucent objects that partially allow light to pass through 
 Transient objects that change shape rapidly 
 2)Imagine you're exploring a dark cave with only a flickering candle as your light source. Suddenly, you notice your shadow cast on the cave wall. Reflecting on this observation, what conclusion can you draw about the light source required to form a shadow? 
   No light source is needed for shadow formation 
 Only an artificial light source like a flashlight 
 Only a natural light source such as sunlight or moonlight 
 Any source of light, whether artificial or natural 
 3)When setting up a shadow puppet show in your living room, you realize you need a screen to project the shadows onto. Considering the nature of shadow play, which of the following materials would be least suitable for creating a clear and defined shadow display? 
   
A cardboard box from a package delivery, providing a solid surface for shadow projection  A clear glass windowpane, allowing light to pass through without obstruction 
 A plastic sheet used for wrapping groceries, offering a semi-translucent surface that may distort shadow shapes  
A sturdy wooden door, providing a stable and opaque background for shadow play  4)Why do shadows tend to be longer in the morning or evening? 
   Because shadows are shorter when the sun is directly overhead 
 Because the angle of the sunlight is lower, causing shadows to stretch 
 Because the length of shadows is random and unpredictable 
 Because the sun is at its highest point in the sky 
 5)If you were to trace the journey of light, how would you describe its path? 
    Like a steadfast traveller, going straight ahead 
 Like a wandering explorer, moving around without a clear direction 
 Like a daring adventurer, cleverly navigating through obstacles 
 Like a graceful dancer, gliding through space 
 6)What happens to the size of a shadow when the object is moved closer to the light source? 
   It becomes larger 
 It remains the same 
 It becomes smaller 
 It disappears 
 7)Imagine you're outside on a sunny day, holding a hula hoop directly above your head. Suddenly, a beam of sunlight shines down onto the hoop. What peculiar change happens to the shadow cast by the hoop? 
   Diagonal	  Elongated   Square  Circular  8)Identify the ancient timekeeping device that relies on the shadows cast by the sun. 
   Sundial  Compass  Stopwatch  Hourglass  9)What is the primary requirement for the formation of a shadow? 
   A transparent object 
 A source of darkness 
 A source of light 
 A reflective surface 
 10)Considering the properties of different materials and their interaction with sunlight, which object is most likely to cast the most defined shadow on a sunny day, and why? 
   A reflective mirror: Rather than casting a shadow, it reflects and redirects sunlight, creating a glare rather than a shadow A solid metal spoon: Due to its dense and opaque nature, it effectively blocks light, resulting in a sharp and well-defined shadow A transparent water bottle: Despite its transparency, its curved surface may cause light to refract and scatter, resulting in a less defined shadow 
 
A translucent plastic ruler: While partially transparent, its material properties may diffuse sunlight, leading to a less distinct shadow 11)Which factor would most likely affect the clarity and distinctiveness of a shadow cast by an object? 
   The size of the light source 
 The shape of the object 
 The material of the object 
 The colour of the object 
 12)How might the formation and characteristics of shadows differ on the surface of the moon compared to Earth? 
   Shadows on the moon would be sharper because moon has no atmosphere to scatter sunlight  
Shadows on the moon would be longer due to the smaller size of the light source Shadows on the moon would be non-existent because of the uniform illumination of the surface 
Shadows on the moon would be fainter because of the lack of reflective surfaces

⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠⁠ObjectiveTo show the electric conductivity of metals and non-metals.  TheoryHave you ever wondered how a bulb glows or how machines work? It's all due to electricity! Electricity is the flow of electrons.Electrical Conductivity refers to the ability of a material to conduct electricity. Materials can conduct electricity only if they have free electrons, which can move across the material.Conductors are materials that permit the flow of electricity. Examples include iron, copper, brass, zinc granules, and stainless steel.                                                                                                                           Fig. 1 Iron nail                                                                                                                         Fig. 2 Copper nail             Insulators are materials that prevent the flow of electricity. Examples include plastic, wood, paper, cloth, and sulphur lumps.                                                                                                                           Fig. 3 Wooden pencil                                                                                                                            Fig. 4 Sulphur lump Making a Circuit to Test ConductivityAn electric cell produces electricity using chemicals inside it. You can make a bulb glow by connecting wires from the cell to the bulb’s terminals. The electricity from the cell travels to the bulb through copper wires, which conduct electricity.To test the conductivity of different materials:1. Cut a part of the copper wire.2. Connect the ends of the wire to the material you want to test.3. Observe if the bulb glows:       a. If the bulb glows, the material is a conductor.                                                                                                       Fig. 5 Circuit diagram of a conductor       b. If the bulb does not glow, the material is an insulator.                                                                                                      Fig. 6 Circuit diagram of an insulator                Conductor’s vs InsulatorsConductors Insulators Iron nail Sulphur lump Zinc granules Coal piece Brass Piece of paper Stainless steel Piece of cloth Table 1. Conductors and Insulator Safety with ElectricityOur body is a good conductor of electricity. Therefore, we must handle electrical appliances with care.Always wear rubber shoes while working with electrical appliances to prevent electric shocks.Wires are coated with plastic or rubber to insulate them and keep us safe from electrical shocks. Emergency Response Skills: Handling ElectrocutionDo not touch the person directly – To avoid electrocution.Turn off the power – Safely disconnect the source of electricity if possible.Use an insulator – Use an insulating object (like rubber or wood) to move the person away from the electrical source.Call for help – Alert emergency services immediately.Provide first aid – Perform CPR (Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation) if trained. Learning outcomesUnderstand the concept of electrical conductivity and its role in distinguishing conductors from insulators.Develop the ability to set up and conduct a simple circuit to test the conductivity of different materials.Recognize the importance of safety measures while handling electrical appliances.  image widget.
